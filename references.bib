MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 8 subjects with rectal tumors suspected to be an early rectal cancer during colonoscopy. All subjects underwent Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Endorectal Ultrasound (ERUS) for staging. Furthermore, all subjects underwent fast switching of tube voltage between 80 and 140~kVp DECT of the pelvis. The 8 subjects had histopathological verified benign adenomas after transanal endoscopic microsurgery resection (TEM). The 8 subjects were matched with 8 consecutively selected subjects with histopathologically verified malignant rectal tumors. The DECT images were analyzed to assess the difference between malignant and benign rectal tumors. All DECT images were reviewed by experienced radiologists. In each DECT scanning, we applied three regions of interest (ROIs) for the acquisition of the DECT unique quantitative parameters. The mean atomic mass (effective Z value), iodine concentration, dual energy ratio (DER) and dual-energy index (DEI) was determined in both groups. RESULTS: The comparison of the 2 groups showed a significant difference in effective Z and a nonsignificant difference regarding iodine concentration, DER, and DEI in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Dual-energy CT demonstrated a difference in the mean atomic mass in benign colorectal tumors in comparison to malignant colorectal tumors.},

This study evaluates whether Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) could contribute to the preoperative lymph node assessment, and compared it to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The objective of this prospective observational feasibility study was to determine the clinical value of the DECT for the detection of metastases in the pelvic lymph nodes of rectal cancer patients and compare the findings to MRI and histopathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were referred to total mesorectal excision (TME) without any neoadjuvant oncological treatment. After surgery the rectum specimen was scanned, and lymph nodes were matched to the pathology report. Fifty-four histology proven rectal cancer patients received a pelvic DECT scan and a standard MRI. The Dual Energy CT quantitative parameters were analyzed: Water and Iodine concentration, Dual-Energy Ratio, Dual Energy Index, and Effective Z value, for the benign and malignant lymph node differentiation. RESULTS: DECT scanning showed statistical difference between malignant and benign lymph nodes in the measurements of iodine concentration, Dual-Energy Ratio, Dual Energy Index, and Effective Z value. Dual energy CT classified 42\% of the cases correctly according to N-stage compared to 40\% for MRI. CONCLUSION: This study showed statistical difference in several quantitative parameters between benign and malignant lymph nodes. There were no difference in the accuracy of lymph node staging between DECT and MRI.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of phased array MRI for T category (T1-2 vs. T3-4), lymph node metastases, and circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement in primary rectal cancer. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched using combinations of keywords relating to rectal cancer and MRI. Reference lists of included articles were also searched by hand. Inclusion criteria were: (1) original article published January 2000-March 2011, (2) use of phased array coil MRI, (3) histopathology used as reference standard, and (4) raw data available to create 2×2 contingency tables. Patients who underwent preoperative long-course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were excluded. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were estimated for each outcome using hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristics and bivariate random effects modeling. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the analysis. There was notable heterogeneity among studies. MRI specificity was significantly higher for CRM involvement [94\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 88-97] than for T category (75\%, 95\% CI 68-80) and lymph nodes (71\%, 95\% CI 59-81). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between the three elements as a result of wide overlapping CIs. Diagnostic odds ratio was significantly higher for CRM (56.1, 95\% CI 15.3-205.8) than for lymph nodes (8.3, 95\% CI 4.6-14.7) but did not differ significantly from T category (20.4, 95\% CI 11.1-37.3). CONCLUSIONS: MRI has good accuracy for both CRM and T category and should be considered for preoperative rectal cancer staging. In contrast, lymph node assessment is poor on MRI.},

Both imaging modalities were compared and the agreement between T- and N-staging of the disease was assessed. RESULTS: We staged 62 patients with rectal cancer during the study period. Of these, 53 patients met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated (25 women and 28 men). The mean age was 57.79 ± 14.99 years (range 21-87). MDCT had poor accuracy compared with EUS in T-staging with a low degree of agreement (kappa = 0.26), while for N-staging MDCT had a better accuracy and a moderate degree of agreement with EUS (kappa = 0.45).

  abstract = {The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual has become the benchmark for classifying patients with cancer, defining prognosis, and determining the best treatment approaches. Many view the primary role of the tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) system as that of a standardized classification system for evaluating cancer at a population level in terms of the extent of disease, both at initial presentation and after surgical treatment, and the overall impact of improvements in cancer treatment. The rapid evolution of knowledge in cancer biology and the discovery and validation of biologic factors that predict cancer outcome and response to treatment with better accuracy have led some cancer experts to question the utility of a TNM-based approach in clinical care at an individualized patient level. In the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the goal of including relevant, nonanatomic (including molecular) factors has been foremost, although changes are made only when there is strong evidence for inclusion. The editorial board viewed this iteration as a proactive effort to continue to build the important bridge from a "population-based" to a more "personalized" approach to patient classification, one that forms the conceptual framework and foundation of cancer staging in the era of precision molecular oncology. The AJCC promulgates best staging practices through each new edition in an effort to provide cancer care providers with a powerful, knowledge-based resource for the battle against cancer. In this commentary, the authors highlight the overall organizational and structural changes as well as "what's new" in the Eighth Edition. It is hoped that this information will provide the reader with a better understanding of the rationale behind the aggregate proposed changes and the exciting developments in the upcoming edition.

For appropriate patient management, accurate lymph node staging is crucial. The present study evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([(18)F]FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for staging and radiotherapy planning of anal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 22 consecutive patients (median age, 61 years old) with anal cancer underwent complete staging evaluation including physical examination, biopsy of the primary tumor, and contrast-enhanced (ce)-PET/CT. Patients were positioned as they would be for their subsequent radiotherapy. PET and CT images were evaluated independently for detectability and localization of the primary tumor, pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes, and distant metastasis. The stage, determined by CT or PET alone, and the proposed therapy planning were compared with the stage and management determined by ce-PET/CT. Data from ce-PET/CT were used for radiotherapy planning. RESULTS: ce-PET/CT revealed locoregional lymph node metastasis in 11 of 22 patients (50\%). After simultaneous reading of PET and CT data sets by experienced observers, 3 patients (14\%) were found to have sites of disease not seen on CT that were identified on PET. Two patients had sites of disease not seen on PET that were identified on CT. In summary, 2 patients were upstaged, and 4 patients were downstaged due to ce-PET/CT. However, radiotherapy fields were changed due to the results from ce-PET/CT in 23\% of cases compared to CT or PET results alone. CONCLUSIONS: ce-PET/CT is superior to PET or CT alone for staging of anal cancer, with significant impact on therapy planning.},

In all patients liver US, pelvic CT and colorectal enema were performed before and after treatment. In 22 patients with low rectal cancer transrectal sonography was performed. In 19 patients pelvic MRI was performed. The 61 patients were considered operable on second staging and thus referred to surgery. Subsequent control on histology has confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of the single procedures and of their combination. US was shown to be of high accuracy in the evaluation of T (90.8\%) and of high predictive value for N. CT accuracy (84\%) and MRI accuracy (78.9\%) was lower because both tend to overstaging in the evaluation of T of rectal tumors undergoing preoperative treatment. Low CT accuracy (64\%) and MRI accuracy (58\%) was observed for N. There was optimum agreement between histology and imaging in the assessment of tumor shrinkage, well visualized by rectal enema which supported combined restaging with 88\% accuracy for T.},

Methods: From November 1997 to June 2001, all patients at VA Puget Sound Healthcare System with a diagnosis of colon cancer were referred for a preoperative CT scan. Medical records and operative notes were reviewed to determine the influence of preoperative CT on clinical management. Results: Seventy patients received a CT per protocol. Preoperative CT provided information that was used in treatment planning and management in 26 (37\%) cases. However, if preoperative scans had not been performed, the clinical management would have been definitively altered in only 13 (19\%) patients. Conclusions: Although these data suggest potential benefit for routine preoperative CT scanning, we believe additional study, including cost analysis, should precede the adoption of CT scanning as a routine preoperative study in patients with colon cancer. © 2002 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging classification that preoperatively assessed the relationship between tumor and the low rectal cancer surgical resection plane (mrLRP). BACKGROUND: Low rectal cancer oncological outcomes remain a global challenge, evidenced by high pathological circumferential resection margin (pCRM) rates and unacceptable variations in permanent colostomies. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, a prospective, observational, multicenter study (MERCURY II) recruited 279 patients with adenocarcinoma 6{$\mkern1mu$}cm or less from the anal verge. MRI assessed the following: mrLRP "safe or unsafe," venous invasion (mrEMVI), depth of spread, node status, tumor height, and tumor quadrant. MRI-based treatment recommendations were compared against final management and pCRM outcomes. RESULTS: Overall pCRM involvement was 9.0\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 5.9-12.3], significantly lower than previously reported rates of 30\%. Patients with no adverse MRI features and a "safe" mrLRP underwent sphincter-preserving surgery without preoperative radiotherapy, resulting in a 1.6\% pCRM rate. The pCRM rate increased 5-fold for an "unsafe" compared with "safe" preoperative mrLRP [odds ratio (OR) = 5.5; 95\% CI, 2.3-13.3)]. Posttreatment MRI reassessment indicated a "safe" ymrLRP in 33 of 113 (29.2\%), none of whom had ypCRM involvement. In contrast, persistent "unsafe" ymrLRP posttherapy resulted in 17.5\% ypCRM involvement. Further independent MRI assessed risk factors were EMVI (OR = 3.8; 95\% CI, 1.5-9.6), tumors less than 4.0{$\mkern1mu$}cm from the anal verge (OR = 3.4; 95\% CI, 1.3-8.8), and anterior tumors (OR = 2.8; 95\% CI, 1.1-6.8). CONCLUSIONS: The study validated MRI low rectal plane assessment, reducing pCRM involvement and avoiding overtreatment through selective preoperative therapy and rationalized use of permanent colostomy. It also highlights the importance of posttreatment restaging.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to correlate and assess diagnostic accuracy of preoperative staging at multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) against the original radiology reports and pathological staging in colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at two institutions. Patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer and available preoperative imaging were included. Preoperative tumor and nodal staging (cT and cN) as determined by the MDT and the radiology report (computed tomography [CT] and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) were recorded. Kappa statistics were used to assess agreement between MDT and the radiology report for cN staging in colon cancer, cT and cN in rectal cancer, and tumor regression grade (TRG) in patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy. Pathological report after surgery served as the reference standard for local staging, and AUROC curves were constructed to compare diagnostic accuracy of the MDT and radiology report. RESULTS: A total of 481 patients were included. Agreement between MDT and radiology report for cN stage was good in colon cancer (k~=~.756, Confidence Interval (CI) 95\% .686-.826). Agreement for cT and cN and in rectal cancer was very good (kw~=~.825, CI 95\% .758-.892) and good (kw~=~.792, CI 95\% .709-.875), respectively. In the rectal cancer group that received neoadjuvant therapy, agreement on TRG was very good (kw~=~.919, CI 95\% .846-.993). AUROC curves using pathological staging indicated no difference in diagnostic accuracy between MDT and radiology reports for either colon or rectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Preoperative colorectal cancer local staging was consistent between specialist MDT review and original radiology reports, with no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy identified.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To update the 2012 ESGAR consensus guidelines on the acquisition, interpretation and reporting of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for clinical staging and restaging of rectal cancer. METHODS: Fourteen abdominal imaging experts from the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) participated in a consensus meeting, organised according to an adaptation of the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method. Two independent (non-voting) Chairs facilitated the meeting. 246 items were scored (comprising 229 items from the previous 2012 consensus and 17 additional items) and classified as 'appropriate' or 'inappropriate' (defined by ≥ 80 \% consensus) or uncertain (defined by {$<$}\enspace 80 \% consensus). RESULTS: Consensus was reached for 226 (92 \%) of items. From these recommendations regarding hardware, patient preparation, imaging sequences and acquisition, criteria for MR imaging evaluation and reporting structure were constructed. The main additions to the 2012 consensus include recommendations regarding use of diffusion-weighted imaging, criteria for nodal staging and a recommended structured report template. CONCLUSIONS: These updated expert consensus recommendations should be used as clinical guidelines for primary staging and restaging of rectal cancer using MRI. KEY POINTS: • These guidelines present recommendations for staging and reporting of rectal cancer. • The guidelines were constructed through consensus amongst 14 pelvic imaging experts. • Consensus was reached by the experts for 92 \% of the 246 items discussed. • Practical guidelines for nodal staging are proposed. • A structured reporting template is presented.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant articles published between 1985 and 2002 were included if more than 20 patients were studied, histopathologic findings were the reference standard, and data were presented for 2 x 2 tables; articles were excluded if data were reported elsewhere in more detail. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics and results. Bivariate random-effects approach was used to obtain summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for invasion of muscularis propria, perirectal tissue, and adjacent organs and for lymph node involvement. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were fitted for perirectal tissue invasion and lymph node involvement. RESULTS: Ninety articles fulfilled all inclusion criteria. For muscularis propria invasion, US and MR imaging had similar sensitivities; specificity of US (86\% [95\% confidence interval [CI]: 80, 90]) was significantly higher than that of MR imaging (69\% [95\% CI: 52, 82]) (P =.02). For perirectal tissue invasion, sensitivity of US (90\% [95\% CI: 88, 92]) was significantly higher than that of CT (79\% [95\% CI: 74, 84]) (P {$<$}.001) and MR imaging (82\% [95\% CI: 74, 87]) (P =.003); specificities were comparable. For adjacent organ invasion and lymph node involvement, estimates for US, CT, and MR imaging were comparable. Summary ROC curve for US of perirectal tissue invasion showed better diagnostic accuracy than that of CT and MR imaging. Summary ROC curves for lymph node involvement showed no differences in accuracy. CONCLUSION: For local invasion, endoluminal US was most accurate and can be helpful in screening patients for available therapeutic strategies.},

This study was a prospective single arm diagnostic accuracy study. All consecutive adult patients with confirmed colon cancer that met the current criteria for surgical resection were considered as eligible. Diagnostic performance assessment included T (T1/T2 vs T3/T4 and\,{$<$}\,T3ab vs\,{$>$}\,T3cd) and N (N positive) staging, serosa and retroperitoneal surgical margin (RSM) involvement and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI). Imaging was based on a 3 Tesla MRI system and the evaluation of all sequences (T1, T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging-DWI series) by two independent readers. CT scan was performed in a 128 row multidetector (MD) CT scanner (slice thickness: 1~mm) with intravenous contrast. Pathology report was considered as the gold standard for local staging. Sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for both observers. MRI displayed a higher diagnostic performance over CT in terms of T1/T2 vs T3/T4 (SE: 100\% vs 83.9\%, SP: 96.6\% vs 81\%, AUC: 0.825 vs 0.983, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), N positive (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and EMVI (p\,=\,0.023) assessment.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the fourth most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The association between cigarette smoking and colorectal cancer has been inconsistent among studies. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association of cigarette smoking and colorectal cancer, we performed a comprehensive literature search and a meta-analysis of observational studies considering both incidence and mortality. DATA SOURCES: We performed a literature search using PubMed, ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), and EMBASE to May 2008, with no restrictions. We also reviewed references from all retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: All articles that were independent and contained the minimum information necessary to estimate the colorectal cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking and a corresponding measure of uncertainty. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed and data were extracted and cross-checked independently by 3 investigators, and any disagreement was resolved by consensus among all 3. RESULTS: One hundred six observational studies were included in the analysis of incidence. Twenty-six studies provided adjusted risk estimates for ever smokers vs never smokers, leading to a pooled relative risk of 1.18 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.25). Smoking was associated with an absolute risk increase of 10.8 cases per 100,000 person-years (95\% CI, 7.9-13.6). We found a statistically significant dose-relationship with an increasing number of pack-years and cigarettes per day. However, the association was statistically significant only after 30 years of smoking. Seventeen cohort studies were included in the analysis of mortality. The pooled risk estimate for ever vs never smokers was 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.37). Smoking was associated with an absolute risk increase of 6.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95\% CI, 4.2-7.6). For both incidence and mortality, the association was stronger for cancer of the rectum than of the colon. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate signal intensity and border characteristics of lymph nodes at high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with rectal cancer and to compare these findings with size in prediction of nodal status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients who underwent total mesorectal excision of the rectum to determine if they had rectal carcinoma were studied with preoperative thin-section MR imaging. Lymph nodes were harvested from 42 transversely sectioned surgical specimens. The slice of each lymph node was carefully matched with its location on the corresponding MR images. Nodal size, border contour, and signal intensity on MR images were characterized and related to histologic involvement with metastases. Differences in sensitivity and specificity with border or signal intensity were calculated with CIs by using method 10 of Newcombe. RESULTS: Of the 437 nodes harvested, 102 were too small ({$<$}3 mm) to be depicted on MR images, and only two of these contained metastases. In 15 (68\%) of 22 patients with nodal metastases, the size of normal or reactive nodes was equal to or greater than that of positive nodes in the same specimen. Fifty-one nodes were above the area imaged, and seven of these contained metastases. The diameter of benign and malignant nodes was similar; therefore, size was a poor predictor of nodal status. If a node was defined as suspicious because of an irregular border or mixed signal intensity, a superior accuracy was obtained and resulted in a sensitivity of 51 (85\%) of 60 (95\% CI: 74\%, 92\%) and a specificity of 216 (97\%) of 221 (95\% CI: 95\%, 99\%). CONCLUSION: Prediction of nodal involvement in rectal cancer with MR imaging is improved by using the border contour and signal intensity characteristics of lymph nodes instead of size criteria.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine the accuracy of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of pathological prognostic factors that influence local recurrence and survival in rectal cancer. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for biopsy-proven rectal cancer were assessed prospectively using high-resolution MRI for tumour (T) and nodal (N) staging using the tumour node metastasis classification, depth of extramural tumour spread, the presence or absence of extramural venous invasion, a threatened circumferential resection margin and serosal involvement at or above the peritoneal reflection. Preoperative magnetic resonance assessment of these prognostic factors was compared with histopathological findings in carefully matched whole-mount sections of the resection specimen. RESULTS: There was 94 per cent weighted agreement (weighted kappa = 0.67) between MRI and pathology assessment of T stage. Agreement between MRI and histological assessment of nodal status was 85 per cent (kappa = 0.68). Although involvement of small veins by tumour was not discernible using MRI, large (calibre greater than 3 mm) extramural venous invasion was identified correctly in 15 of 18 patients (kappa = 0.64). MRI predicted circumferential resection margin involvement with 92 per cent agreement (kappa = 0.81). Seven of nine patients with peritoneal perforation by tumour (stage T4) were identified correctly using MRI. CONCLUSION: High-resolution MRI of the rectum allows preoperative identification of important surgical and pathological prognostic risk factors. This may allow both better selection and assessment of patients undergoing preoperative therapy.},

The clinical relevance of improvement in mrEMVI following neoadjuvant therapy is unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate that regression of mrEMVI following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) results in improved outcomes and mrEMVI can be used as an imaging biomarker. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted examining the staging and post-treatment MRIs of patients who had presented with EMVI-positive rectal cancer. All patients had undergone neoadjuvant CRT and curative surgery. Changes in mrEMVI were graded with a new MRI-based TRG scale-mr-vTRG; and related to disease-free survival (DFS). The study fulfilled Reporting Recommendations for Tumour Marker Prognostic Studies criteria for biomarkers. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included. Thirty-five patients showed more than 50\% fibrosis of mrEMVI (mr-vTRG 1-3); 3-year DFS 87.8\% and 9\% recurrence. Twenty-seven patients showed less than 50\% fibrosis (mr-vTRG 4-5); 3-year DFS 45.8\% with 44\% recurrence - P{$<$}0.0001. On multivariate Cox-regression, only mr-vTRG 4-5 increased risk of disease recurrence - HR=5.748. CONCLUSION: Patients in whom there has been a significant response of EMVI to CRT show improved DFS. Those patients with poor response should be considered for intensive treatment. As an imaging biomarker in rectal cancer, mrEMVI can be used.},

With recent clinical trials exploring the expansion of the use of neoadjuvant therapy beyond the anorectum to the remainder of the colon, the current and future state of colon cancer treatment is evolving with a renewed interest in evaluating the role radiology may play in the primary T staging of colon cancer. The performance of CT, CT colonography, MRI, and FDG PET-CT for colon cancer staging will be reviewed. N staging will also be briefly discussed.

Since then, ten prospective studies have published new results. Here we update the evidence from prospective studies and explore whether there is a non-linear association of red and processed meats with colorectal cancer risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relevant prospective studies were identified in PubMed until March 2011. For each study, relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled with a random-effects model, weighting for the inverse of the variance, in highest versus lowest intake comparison, and dose-response meta-analyses. Red and processed meats intake was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk. The summary relative risk (RR) of colorectal cancer for the highest versus the lowest intake was 1.22 (95\% CI {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 1.11-1.34) and the RR for every 100 g/day increase was 1.14 (95\% CI {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 1.04-1.24). Non-linear dose-response meta-analyses revealed that colorectal cancer risk increases approximately linearly with increasing intake of red and processed meats up to approximately 140 g/day, where the curve approaches its plateau. The associations were similar for colon and rectal cancer risk. When analyzed separately, colorectal cancer risk was related to intake of fresh red meat (RR(for 100 g/day increase) {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 1.17, 95\% CI {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 1.05-1.31) and processed meat (RR (for 50 g/day increase) {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 1.18, 95\% CI {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 1.10-1.28). Similar results were observed for colon cancer, but for rectal cancer, no significant associations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: High intake of red and processed meat is associated with significant increased risk of colorectal, colon and rectal cancers. The overall evidence of prospective studies supports limiting red and processed meat consumption as one of the dietary recommendations for the prevention of colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many surgical options, eventually combined with neoadjuvant therapy, are available for the treatment of rectal cancer. Preoperative staging is essential to plan the correct treatment. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in the local staging of rectal cancer. METHODS: Between February 1995 and May 2000, 105 patients (65 male, 40 female; mean age = 58, range = 36-88 years) after preoperative locoregional CT staging underwent rectal resection for rectal cancer. In all patients, radiologic T and N staging was verified with pathologic examination of excised specimens. Patients were examined after air insufflation of the ampulla, during intravenous contrast injection; analysis of the rectoanal region was performed with thin (3-5 mm) contiguous slices. For T staging, Tis-T2, T3, and T4 groups were considered. For N staging, two groups of patients were considered: in 52 patients, N+ stage was attributed to all visible lymph nodes; in the other 53 patients, only lymph nodes {$>$}5 mm were recorded as N+. RESULTS: Pathologic examination showed 61 T1-T2, 40 T3, and four T4 tumors; CT examination correctly identified 50 T1-T2 (81.9\%), 33 T3 (82.5\%), and three T4 (75\%) lesions. With regard to N stage, pathologic examination in the first group (52 patients) showed only 11 cases of lymph node involvement. CT examination detected all 11 true-positive lymph nodes but overestimated 30 false-positive cases. In the second group (53 patients), pathology showed 26 cases of nodal involvement: CT examination identified 23 true-positive, 19 true-negative, eight false-positive, and three false-negative lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: CT correctly staged 86 (82\%) of 105 lesions. Overestimation occurred in T2 patients (11 of 61, 18\%) and underestimation in T3 patients (seven of 33, 21\%), in accordance with other reports dealing with superior accuracy of endorectal ultrasonography in local staging of early disease. Conversely, the criterion we suggest for evaluating metastatic perirectal lymph nodes (diameter {$>$} 5 mm) provided 79.2\% diagnostic accuracy, 88.5\% sensitivity, and 86.5\% negative predictive value. This can be useful in those patients in whom prompt surgery, soon after radiochemotherapy in the case of nodal involvement, may likely be curative. With further improvement with spiral CT in local staging and nodal involvement, a larger number of transanal curative resections can be predicted.},

These findings were compared with the micro- and macrohistologic findings obtained from the surgical specimens. As far as perirectal fat infiltration is concerned, the diagnostic accuracy of CT was 73\% and that of MRI was 71\%. Sensitivity was 100\% for CT and 91\% for MRI, while specificity was low for both techniques (45\% for CT and 50\% for MRI). In evaluating local adenopathy, CT accuracy was 82\% and MR accuracy was 90\%, with 89\% sensitivity for both techniques and 77\% specificity for CT and 92\% for MRI. The overall accuracy was 59\% for CT and 67\% for MRI. In agreement with literature data, our study shows a similar accuracy for CT and MRI in evaluating the local extent of rectal carcinomas.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The wide global variation in the definition of the rectum has led to significant inconsistencies in trial recruitment, clinical management, and outcomes. Surgical technique and use of preoperative treatment for a cancer of the rectum and sigmoid colon are radically different and dependent on the local definitions employed by the clinical team. A consensus definition of the rectum is needed to standardise treatment. METHODS: The consensus was conducted using the Delphi technique with multidisciplinary colorectal experts from October, 2017 to April, 2018. RESULTS: Eleven different definitions for the rectum were used by participants in the consensus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the most frequent modality used to define the rectum (67\%), and the preferred modality for 72\% of participants. The most agreed consensus landmark (56\%) was "the sigmoid take-off," an anatomic, image-based definition of the junction of the mesorectum and mesocolon. In the second round, 81\% of participants agreed that the sigmoid take-off as seen on computed tomography or MRI achieved consensus, and that it could be implemented in their institution. Also, 87\% were satisfied with the sigmoid take-off as the consensus landmark. CONCLUSION: An international consensus definition for the rectum is the point of the sigmoid take-off as visualized on imaging. The sigmoid take-off can be identified as the mesocolon elongates as the ventral and horizontal course of the sigmoid on axial and sagittal views respectively on cross-sectional imaging. Routine application of this landmark during multidisciplinary team discussion for all patients will enable greater consistency in tumour localisation.},

Results In 17 patients, the mean distance from the anterior peritoneal reflection to the RSJ on MRI was 20.3mm and 23.1mm for two readers, and on pathology was 20.6mm. The mean differences between MRI and specimen measurements were -0.31mm (-2.83 to 2.20mm), and 2.51mm (95\% confidence interval -0.31 to 5.33mm) for each reader, with correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.81. Conclusion The sigmoid take-off has been validated on specimen analysis to be an imaging landmark that defines the termination of the rectum. This anatomical landmark can be used to classify tumours and guide treatment and research of sigmoid colon and rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Aim This study aimed to assess the reliability of measurements and bony landmarks for the rectosigmoid junction on MRI. Method The staging MRI scans for 100 patients were reviewed. The junction of the mesorectum and mesocolon was used to identify the rectum and sigmoid. The performance of current metric measurements or bony landmarks was then compared against the actual anatomical bowel segment. Results The mean distance of the sigmoid take-off from the anal verge was 12.6 cm (SD 1.8 cm, range 9.4–19.0 cm). At a cutoff of 12 cm, the anatomical bowel segment was found to be sigmoid colon rather than rectum in 35\% of patients. At 15 and 16 cm the bowel segment was sigmoid in 84\% and 96\% of patients, respectively. At the sacral promontory and the third sacral segment, the bowel segment was sigmoid in 28\% and 100\% of patients, respectively. Conclusion Current definitions of the rectum that rely on arbitrary measurements or bony landmarks will not locate the correct point of transition between the rectum and sigmoid in the majority of patients. The sigmoid take-off offers an alternative, anatomically bespoke, landmark.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Controversy surrounds the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in ulcerative colitis (UC). Many studies have investigated this risk and reported widely varying rates. METHODS: A literature search using Medline with the explosion of references identified 194 studies. Of these, 116 met our inclusion criteria from which the number of patients and cancers detected could be extracted. Overall pooled estimates, with 95\% confidence intervals (CI), of cancer prevalence and incidence were obtained using a random effects model on either the log odds or log incidence scale, as appropriate. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of CRC in any UC patient, based on 116 studies, was estimated to be 3.7\% (95\% CI 3.2-4.2\%). Of the 116 studies, 41 reported colitis duration. From these the overall incidence rate was 3/1000 person years duration (pyd), (95\% CI 2/1000 to 4/1000). The overall incidence rate for any child was 6/1000 pyd (95\% CI 3/1000 to 13/1000). Of the 41 studies, 19 reported results stratified into 10 year intervals of disease duration. For the first 10 years the incidence rate was 2/1000 pyd (95\% CI 1/1000 to 2/1000), for the second decade the incidence rate was estimated to be 7/1000 pyd (95\% CI 4/1000 to 12/1000), and in the third decade the incidence rate was 12/1000 pyd (95\% CI 7/1000 to 19/1000). These incidence rates corresponded to cumulative probabilities of 2\% by 10 years, 8\% by 20 years, and 18\% by 30 years. The worldwide cancer incidence rates varied geographically, being 5/1000 pyd in the USA, 4/1000 pyd in the UK, and 2/1000 pyd in Scandinavia and other countries. Over time the cancer risk has increased since 1955 but this finding was not significant (p=0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Using new meta-analysis techniques we determined the risk of CRC in UC by decade of disease and defined the risk in pancolitics and children. We found a non-significant increase in risk over time and estimated how risk varies with geography.},

The substantial morbidity and mortality of such resections warrant stringent patient selection. Recent literature reports PET to be of additional value to CT for the detection of metastases in colorectal cancer patients. We studied the clinical impact of PET in pelvic rectal cancer recurrence. METHODS: PET findings in 37 pelvic recurrences of rectal cancer were evaluated retrospectively. Comparison was made to CT and MRI findings. It was analyzed whether PET had been decisive in clinical decision making or could have been so. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients had 37 rectal cancer recurrences. PET differed from conventional imaging in 13 cases (35\%): seven PET scans showed lesions that were not seen with CT or MRI. PET scans were negative in six lesions detected by CT or MRI. PET alone changed management in five recurrences (14\%). Four PET scans were false-positive; this had clinical implications in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: In a selected population with pelvic rectal cancer recurrences, PET had additional value to conventional imaging, mainly in detecting lymph node metastases. PET findings thus had a significant impact on selection of patients for curative surgery.},

The optimal sequence of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and chemotherapy (CT) is a matter of debate. METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 and OPRA multicenter, randomized phase 2 trials to identify patient subsets that could benefit from one TNT sequence over the other regarding disease-free survival (DFS). Patients with stage II/III rectal cancer were randomized to CRT (50.4-54~Gy) with either induction (INCT-CRT) or consolidation CT (CRT-CNCT) with fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (CAO/ARO/AIO-12 and OPRA) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin (OPRA) followed by mandatory total mesorectal excision (TME) (CAO/ARO/AIO-12) or selective watch-and-wait surveillance (OPRA). 311 and 324 patients were recruited from June 15, 2015 to January 31, 2018; and from April 12, 2014 to March 30, 2020 in the two trials, respectively. Pretreatment clinical and tumor characteristics included were age, sex, ECOG, cT-category, cN-category, clinical UICC stage, location from anal verge, and tumor grade. FINDINGS: In total, 628 eligible patients were included in the pooled analysis (CAO/ARO/AIO-12, n~=~304; OPRA, n~=~324). Of those, 313 were randomly assigned to the INCT-CRT group, and 315 to the CRT-CNCT group. Median follow-up was 43 months (IQR, 35-49) months in the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial and 61,2 months (IQR, 42-68,4) in the OPRA trial. Pooled analysis of baseline clinical and tumor characteristics did not identify any subgroups of patients that would benefit by the one TNT sequence over the other with regard to DFS. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first pooled analysis of two randomized trials after direct head-to-head comparison of both TNT sequences. Both trials reported higher rates of complete response with CRT-CNCT, and this should be considered the preferred TNT sequence if organ preservation is a priority.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer represents a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Staging defines the local and distant extent of the disease, guides management, and predicts prognosis. Different modalities are available for staging including TRUS (transrectal ultrasound), CT (computed tomography), and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to screen and isolate CT imaging parameters suggestive of advanced rectal cancer and its utility as a tool in simplifying the staging protocol making further imaging studies unnecessary. DESIGN: Retrospective, single center study. PATIENTS AND SETTINGS: Seventy-five patients with rectal carcinoma were included and were divided into two groups according to their T score and nodal involvement status, as diagnosed by TRUS. Group 1 (n\,=\,15) "local disease" (T1/T2 N0) and group 2 (n\,=\,60) "locally advanced disease" are both eligible for neoadjuvant treatment (N/any T or T3/any N). For each patient, three CT imaging parameters that represent locally advanced disease, i.e., perirectal fat infiltration, local lymphadenopathy, and rectal wall thickening, were evaluated and compared between the two groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The capability of CT imaging to accurately predict locally advanced rectal carcinoma. RESULTS: Rectal wall thickening on CT was found to have 92\% PPV and perirectal lymphadenopathy 96\% PPV for predicting a locally advanced stage. A combination of those two parameters results in a predictive PPV of 98\%. LIMITATIONS: This was a single center retrospective study, with a relatively small cohort. CONCLUSIONS: CT is a valuable tool in the assessment and management of rectal carcinoma as it can identify locally advanced rectal cancer. This enables treatment without any further unnecessary evaluation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether histopathological confirmed extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) is associated with quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) of rectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with rectal cancer who underwent rectal cancer surgery and DECT (including arterial-, venous-, and delay-phase scanning) between November 2019 and November 2020. The EMVI of rectal cancer was confirmed via postoperative pathological results. Iodine concentration (IC), IC normalized to the aorta (NIC), and CT attenuation values of the three phases were measured and compared between patients with and without EMVI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic performance of these DECT quantitative parameters. RESULTS: Herein, 36 patients (22 men and 14 women) with a mean age of 62 [range, 43-77] years) with (n~=~13) and without (n~=~23) EMVI were included. Patients with EMVI exhibited significantly higher IC in the venous and delay phases (venous-phase: 2.92~±~0.6 vs 2.34~±~0.48; delay-phase: 2.46~±~0.47 vs 1.88~±~0.35) and NIC in all the three phases (arterial-phase: 0.31~±~0.12 vs 0.24~±~0.06; venous-phase: 0.58~±~0.11 vs 0.41~±~0.07; delay-phase: 0.68~±~0.10 vs 0.46~±~0.08) than patients without EMVI. Among them, the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained in the delay-phase NIC (AUC~=~0.983). IC in the arterial-phase and CT attenuation in all the three phases did not significantly differ between patients with and without EMVI (p~=~0.205-0.869). CONCLUSION: Iodine quantification using dual-energy CT, especially the NIC of the tumor, differs between the EMVI-positive and EMVI-negative groups and seems to help predict the EMVI of rectal cancer in this preliminary study; however, a larger sample size study is warranted in the future.},

This study aims to propose a deep learning (DL)-based workflow towards fully automated clinical target volume (CTV) and gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation for rectal cancer neoadjuvant radiotherapy. MATERIALS \& METHODS: We retrospectively included 141 patients with Stage II-III mid-low rectal cancer and randomly grouped them into training (n\,=\,121) and testing (n\,=\,20) cohorts. We adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy to address CTV and GTV segmentation using two separate DL models with DpuUnet as backend-one model for CTV segmentation in the CT domain, and the other for GTV in the MRI domain. The workflow was validated using a three-level multicenter-involved blind and randomized evaluation scheme. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD) metrics were calculated in Level 1, four-grade expert scoring was performed in Level 2, and head-to-head Turing test in Level 3. RESULTS: For the DL-based CTV contours over the testing cohort, the DSC and 95HD (mean\,±\,SD) were 0.85\,±\,0.06 and 7.75\,±\,6.42~mm respectively, and 96.4\% cases achieved clinical viable scores (≥\,2). The positive rate in the Turing test was 52.3\%. For GTV, the DSC and 95HD were 0.87\,±\,0.07 and 4.07\,±\,1.67~mm respectively, and 100\% of the DL-based contours achieved clinical viable scores (≥\,2). The positive rate in the Turing test was 52.0\%. CONCLUSION: The proposed DL-based workflow exhibited promising accuracy and excellent clinical viability towards automated CTV and GTV delineation for rectal cancer neoadjuvant radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {Eighteen cases of rectal carcinoma were staged preoperatively with transrectal endosonography (EUS), CT and MRI (0.5 T). The results were compared with surgical specimens and histology to evaluate the accuracy of the imaging modalities in staging rectal carcinomas which had been quantified according to Astler-Coller's classification. All methods identified the lesion (100\% sensitivity). EUS and MRI correctly staged 8 cases (44\%) and CT 9 cases (50\%). CT and MRI mistakes were relative to overstaging, whereas EUS understaged 4 cases (22\%) and overstaged 6 cases (33\%). In local tumor staging ("T" variable), CT and MRI understaged no lesions, thus exhibiting 100\% sensitivity, which was higher than EUS sensitivity (92\%). Conversely, CT and MRI more frequently overstaged the lesions, thus demonstrating lower sensitivity than EUS (55\% and 50\%, respectively, versus 76\% for EUS). As for the "N" variable, EUS identified node metastases in one case only (25\%) and misdiagnosed as positive 4 cases of negative node involvement. All the C-stage lesions were correctly diagnosed by CT and MRI (whose findings were in agreement) which also overstaged as C three cases with hyperplastic node enlargement. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS, which was highest for the A and B1 stages, progressively decreased for bigger lesions, clearly understaging node involvement. On the contrary, CT and MRI accuracy rates were lower in small tumors involving the rectal wall only, whereas they always identified tumor spread beyond the bowel wall into perirectal fat, and node metastases. Therefore, to conclude, EUS can be used first: in case of extraluminal tumor spread, CT is the method of choice, more accurate than MRI in identifying node involvement and equally effective in evaluating perirectal fat infiltration and pelvic structures involvement. Whenever the pelvic floor is involved, MRI is the best imaging method, thanks to its multiplanar capabilities, for better detailing of musculoskeletal involvement.},

For N1 = LN {$>$} 1 cm or an increased number of LN {$<$} 1 cm the sensitivity was 71\%. In patients with a primary tumor seen on CT, sensitivity rose to 87\%. DISCUSSION: Evidence of regional nodal metastatic disease is only relevant for rectal cancer, colon polyps, and for locally excised tumors when considering present surgical concepts for the treatment of colorectal cancer. In these cases CT analysis using the broadened criteria for N1 proposes a valuable argument regarding possible preoperative radiotherapy or an operative revision.},

It is unclear which variables, including assessment of tumor regression, are the best indicators for local recurrence and survival. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A series of 201 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3/T4, M0) presenting with an involved or at least threatened circumferential margin (CRM) on preoperative imaging ({$<$}2 mm) were evaluated using standard histopathologic variables and four different histologic regression systems. All patients received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy. The prognostic value of all factors was tested with univariate survival analysis of time to local recurrence and overall survival. RESULTS: Local recurrence occurred in only 8\% of the patients with a free CRM compared with 43\% in case of CRM involvement (P {$<$} 0.0001). None of the four regression systems were associated with prognosis, not even when corrected for CRM status. However, we did observe a higher degree of tumor regression after radiochemotherapy compared with radiotherapy (P {$<$} 0.001). Absence of tumor regression was associated with increasing invasion depth and a positive CRM (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of CRM involvement is the most important pathologic variable after radiochemotherapy. Although tumor regression increases the chance on a free CRM, in cases with positive resection margins prognosis is poor irrespective of the degree of therapy-induced regression.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients who had been diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma (30 patients with EMVI and 28 patients without EMVI) were enrolled in the study. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the tumour and the EMVI (+) vein, the lengths of the tumours were measured on MRI. The diameters of the superior rectal vein (SRV)-inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and distant metastatic spread were evaluated on CT. The ability of these findings to detect EMVI was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Pathology was accepted as the reference test for EMVI. RESULTS: Mean diameters of the SRV (4.9~±~0.9~mm vs 3.7~±~0.8~mm) and IMV (6.9~±~0.8~mm vs 5.4~±~0.9~mm) were significantly larger (P~{$<~$}.001) and tumour ADC values were significantly lower (0.926~±~0.281~×~10-3~mm2/s vs 1.026~±~0.246~×~10-3~mm2/s; P~=~.032) in EMVI (+) patients. Diameters of 3.95~mm for the SRV (area under the curve [AUC]~±~standard error [SE]: 0.851~±~0.051, P~{$<~$}.001, sensitivity: 93.3\%, specificity: 67.9\%) and 5.95~mm for the IMV (AUC~±~SE: 0.893~±~0.040, P~{$<~$}.001, sensitivity: 93.3\%, specificity: 71.4\%) and an ADC value of 0.929~×~10-3~mm2/s (AUC~±~SE: 0.664~±~0.072, P~=~.032 sensitivity: 76.7\%, specificity: 57.1\%) were found to be cutoff values, determined by ROC analysis, for detection of EMVI. Distant metastases were significantly more prevalent in EMVI (+) patients (P~{$<~$}.001). CONCLUSION: The measurement of ADC values and SRV-IMV diameters seems to have contribution for diagnosis of EMVI in rectal adenocarcinoma. EMVI (+) patients appear to have higher risks of distant metastases at diagnosis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials demonstrate the superiority of preoperative over postoperative radiotherapy (XRT) in diminishing rates of local recurrence of transmurally infiltrating (T3/4) rectal tumors. The dosage and cost of preoperative XRT are less than postoperative XRT. The economic and health impact of transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) on rectal cancer management has not been described. The aim of this study was to apply a decision analysis model to compare the cost-effectiveness of three staging strategies in the evaluation of nonmetastatic proximal rectal cancer: abdominal and pelvic CT versus abdominal CT plus EUS versus abdominal CT plus pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: A decision model was designed using DATA Version 3.5 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA), taking as entry criteria nonmetastatic proximal rectal cancer as determined by abdominal CT. In each arm, detection of transmural invasion prompted preoperative XRT. Baseline probabilities were varied through plausible ranges using sensitivity analysis. Cost inputs were based on Medicare professional plus facility fees. Endpoints were cost of treatment per patient and tumor recurrence-free rates. Cost-effectiveness (cost per prevention of local recurrence) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: For proximal rectal tumors, evaluation with abdominal CT plus EUS is the most cost-effective approach (\$24,468/yr) compared with abdominal CT plus pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (\$24,870) and CT alone (\$26,076). Both the magnetic resonance imaging- and CT-only approaches were dominated (i.e., more costly and less effective). CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal CT plus EUS is the most cost-effective staging strategy for nonmetastatic proximal rectal cancer. Staging strategies incorporating EUS improve treatment allocation by achieving more accurate T staging, thereby optimizing the benefit of preoperative XRT to more advanced tumors.},

The use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of perirectal nodes in this setting has not been evaluated. The aim of this prospective, blinded study of patients with rectal cancer was to assess the impact of preoperative staging on treatment decisions and compare the tumor (T), nodal (N) staging performance characteristics of pelvic computed tomography (CT), rectal endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and EUS FNA. METHODS: Eighty consecutive patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer were prospectively evaluated. Therapy decisions were recorded after sequential disclosure of staging information to the patient's surgeon. RESULTS: In 31\% of patients (95\% confidence interval, 21\%-42\%), EUS staging information changed the surgeon's original treatment plan based on CT alone. The further addition of FNA changed therapy in one patient. T staging accuracy was 71\% (CT) and 91\% (EUS) (P = 0.02); N staging accuracy was 76\% (CT), 82\% (EUS), and 76\% (EUS FNA) (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative staging with EUS results in more frequent use of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy than if staging was performed with CT alone. The addition of FNA only changed the management of one patient, whereas FNA did not significantly improve N staging accuracy over EUS alone. FNA seems to offer the most potential for impacting management in those patients with early T stage disease, and its use should be confined to this subgroup of patients. EUS is more accurate than CT for determining T stage of rectal carcinoma.},

METHODS: Twenty-one patients underwent 1.5-T MRI followed by surgery (± preoperative 5\,×\,5 Gy). Imaging consisted of T2-weighted MRI, DWI (b0, 500, 1000), and 3DT1-weighted MRI with 1-mm isotropic voxels. The latter was used for accurate detection and per lesion histological validation of nodes. Two independent readers analysed the signal intensity on DWI and measured the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for each node (ADCnode) and the ADC of each node relative to the mean tumour ADC (ADCrel). RESULTS: DWI detected 6 \% more nodes than T2W-MRI. The signal on DWI was not accurate for the differentiation of metastatic nodes (AUC 0.45-0.50). Interobserver reproducibility for the nodal ADC measurements was excellent (ICC 0.93). Mean ADCnode was higher for benign than for malignant nodes (1.15\,±\,0.24 vs. 1.04\,±\,0.22 *10(-3) mm(2)/s), though not statistically significant (P\,=\,0.10). Area under the ROC curve/sensitivity/specificity for the assessment of metastatic nodes were 0.64/67 \%/60 \% for ADCnode and 0.67/75 \%/61 \% for ADCrel.

The overall accuracy in staging depth of infiltration was 89 percent. Overstaging occurred in 10.2 percent, understaging in 0.8 percent. Tumors of the lower rectum are incorrectly staged in 16.7 percent, whereas tumors of the middle and upper rectum had an incorrect staging in 6.3 percent (P {$<$} 0.001).

The aim of this study is to clarify the usefulness of circumferential tumor extent determined by computed tomography (CT) colonography in differentiating T3 or T4 from T1 or T2 rectal cancer. METHODS: Seventy consecutive rectal cancer patients who underwent curative-intent surgery were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent colonoscopy and CT colonography on the same day. The circumferential tumor extent was estimated in 10\% increments. The pathological T stage was used as the reference. RESULTS: The median circumferential tumor extent evaluated by colonoscopy for T1 (n = 6), T2 (n = 21), and T3/T4 (n = 43) were 10\%, 30\%, and 80\%, respectively (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4, p {$<$} 0.0001). The median circumferential tumor extent evaluated by CT colonography for T1, T2, and T3/T4 is 10\%, 30\%, and 70\%, respectively (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4, p {$<$} 0.0001). The correlation coefficient between colonoscopy and CT colonography was very high (0.94). By defining a circumferential tumor extent ≥ 50\% by CT colonography as the criterion for stage T3 or T4, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy were 72\%, 88\%, 91\%, and 79\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Circumferential tumor extent ≥ 50\% determined by CT colonography is a simple and potentially useful marker to identify candidates for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality and is considered to be largely attributable to inappropriate lifestyle and behavior patterns. The purpose of this review was to undertake a comparison of the strength of the associations between known and putative risk factors for colorectal cancer by conducting 10 independent meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies. Studies published between 1966 and January 2008 were identified through EMBASE and MEDLINE, using a combined text word and MESH heading search strategy. Studies were eligible if they reported estimates of the relative risk for colorectal cancer with any of the following: alcohol, smoking, diabetes, physical activity, meat, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables. Studies were excluded if the estimates were not adjusted at least for age. Overall, data from 103 cohort studies were included. The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly associated with alcohol: individuals consuming the most alcohol had 60\% greater risk of colorectal cancer compared with non- or light drinkers (relative risk 1.56, 95\% CI 1.42-1.70). Smoking, diabetes, obesity and high meat intakes were each associated with a significant 20\% increased risk of colorectal cancer (compared with individuals in the lowest categories for each) with little evidence of between-study heterogeneity or publication bias. Physical activity was protective against colorectal cancer. Public-health strategies that promote modest alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, weight loss, increased physical activity and moderate consumption of red and processed meat are likely to have significant benefits at the population level for reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {AIM: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) as compared with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in identifying mesorectal fascia (MRF) invasion in rectal cancer patients. METHODS: Ninety-one patients with biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma referred for thoracic and abdominal CT staging were enrolled in this study. The contrast-enhanced MDCT scans were performed on a 256 row scanner (ICT, Philips) with the following acquisition parameters: tube voltage 120 KV, tube current 150-300 mAs. Imaging data were reviewed as axial and as multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) images along the rectal tumor axis. MRI study, performed on 1.5 T with dedicated phased array multicoil, included multiplanar T2 and axial T1 sequences and diffusion weighted images (DWI). Axial and MPR CT images independently were compared to MRI and MRF involvement was determined. Diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was compared and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: According to MRI, the MRF was involved in 51 patients and not involved in 40 patients. DWI allowed to recognize the tumor as a focal mass with high signal intensity on high b-value images, compared with the signal of the normal adjacent rectal wall or with the lower tissue signal intensity background. The number of patients correctly staged by the native axial CT images was 71 out of 91 (41 with involved MRF; 30 with not involved MRF), while by using the MPR 80 patients were correctly staged (45 with involved MRF; 35 with not involved MRF). Local tumor staging suggested by MDCT agreed with those of MRI, obtaining for CT axial images sensitivity and specificity of 80.4\% and 75\%, positive predictive value (PPV) 80.4\%, negative predictive value (NPV) 75\% and accuracy 78\%; while performing MPR the sensitivity and specificity increased to 88\% and 87.5\%, PPV was 90\%, NPV 85.36\% and accuracy 88\%. MPR images showed higher diagnostic accuracy, in terms of MRF involvement, than native axial images, as compared to the reference magnetic resonance images. The difference in accuracy was statistically significant (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: New generation CT scanner, using high resolution MPR images, represents a reliable diagnostic tool in assessment of loco-regional and whole body staging of advanced rectal cancer, especially in patients with MRI contraindications.},

A clinical decision regarding the type of surgery to be performed was made prior to CT scanning, and this was then compared with the final surgery performed for each patient. The reason for any change in management was noted. Definitive management differed from proposed management in 14 of 116 patients studied. Surgery was avoided in one patient found to have multiple liver metastases on the CT scan. Operative findings changed the management in the remaining 13 patients. Seven patients had less aggressive surgery than proposed, one patient's surgery was abandoned because of extensive disease, and five patients had more radical surgery. Routine pre-operative CT scanning of the abdomen in patients with colorectal cancer does not seem to be justified from the results of this study.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify published studies quantifying familial colorectal cancer (CRC) risks in first-degree relatives of CRC and colorectal adenoma (CRA) cases and, through a meta-analysis, obtain more precise estimates of familial risk according to the nature of the family history and type of neoplasm. METHODS: Twenty-seven case-control and cohort studies were identified, which reported risks of CRC in relatives of CRC cases and nine, which reported the risk of CRC in relatives of CRA cases. Pooled estimates of risk for various categories of family history were obtained by calculating the weighted average of the log relative risk estimates from studies. RESULTS: The pooled estimates of relative risk were as follows: a first-degree relative with CRC 2.25 (95\% CI = 2.00-2.53), colon 2.42 (95\% CI = 2.20-2.65), and rectal 1.89 (95\% CI = 1.62-2.21) cancer; parent with CRC 2.26 (95\% CI = 1.87-2.72); sibling with CRC 2.57 (95\% CI = 2.19-3.02); more than one relative with CRC 4.25 (95\% CI = 3.01-6.08); relative diagnosed with CRC before age 45, 3.87 (95\% CI = 2.40-6.22); and a relative with CRA 1.99 (95\% CI = 1.55-2.55). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a family history of CRC and CRA have a significantly elevated risk of developing CRC compared with those without such a history. Risks are greatest for relatives of patients diagnosed young, those with two or more affected relatives, and relatives of patients with colonic cancers.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the performance of computed tomography (CT) in the local staging of colon cancer in different segments, with emphasis on parameters that have been found to be significant for rectal cancer, namely, extramural venous invasion (EMVI) and tumor deposits (TDs). METHODS: CT and pathology data from 137 patients were independently reviewed by radiology and pathology teams. The performance of CT in categorizing a given patient into good, versus poor prognostic groups was assessed for each segment, as well as the presence of lymph nodes (LNs), TDs and EMVIs. Discordant cases were re-evaluated to determine potential sources of error. Elastic stain was applied for EMVI discordance. RESULTS: The T staging accuracy was 80.2\%. For T stage stratification, CT performed slightly better in the left colon, and the lowest accuracy was in the transverse colon. Under-staging was more common (in 12.4\%), and most of the mis-staged cases were in sigmoid colon. According to the first comprehensive correlative analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT for detecting TDs were found to be 57.9\%, 92.4\%, 87.6\%, respectively. These figures were 44.7\%, 72.7\%, and 63.5\% for LN, and 58.5\%, 82.1\% and 73\% for EMVI. The detection rate was better for multifocal EMVI. The detection rate was also comparable (although substantially underestimated) for LNs, with the half of the LNs missed by CT being\,{$<$}\,5~mm. Four patients that were classified as TD by CT, disclosed to be LNs by pathology. Correlative analysis led to refinement of the pathology criteria, with subsequent modifications of the initial reports in 13 (9.5\%) patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, CT performed well in the evaluation of colon cancer, as did TD and EMVI. It is advisable to include these parameters in CT-based staging. Radiologists should be aware of the pitfalls that occur more commonly in different segments.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients diagnosed with rectal cancer were included in this prospective study. All patients underwent both pCT and DCE-MRI. Imaging was performed on a dedicated 40-slice CT-positron emission tomography system and a 3-T MRI system. Dynamic contrast enhancement was measured in tumor tissue and the external iliac artery. Tumor perfusion was quantified in terms of pharmacokinetic parameters: transfer constant K(trans), fractional extravascular-extracellular space v(e), and fractional plasma volume v(p). Pharmacokinetic parameter values and their heterogeneity (by 80\% quantile value) were compared between pCT and DCE-MRI. RESULTS: Tumor K(trans) values correlated significantly for the voxel-by-voxel-derived median (Kendall's tau correlation, tau = 0.81, p {$<$} 0.001) and 80\% quantile (tau = 0.54, p = 0.04), as well as for the averaged uptake (tau = 0.58, p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were found for v(e) and v(p) derived from the voxel-by-voxel-derived median and 80\% quantile and derived from the averaged uptake curves. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated for the first time that pCT provides K(trans) values comparable to those of DCE-MRI. However, no correlation was found for the v(e) and v(p) parameters between CT and MRI. Computed tomography can serve as an alternative modality to MRI for the in vivo evaluation of tumor angiogenesis in terms of the transfer constant K(trans).},

This review presents commonly encountered findings in the diagnosis and staging of patients with colorectal cancer using computed tomography (CT) colonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT colonography. CT colonography provides important information for the preoperative assessment of T staging. Wall deformities are associated with muscular or subserosal invasion. Lymph node metastases from colorectal cancer often present with calcifications. CT is superior to detect calcified metastases. Three-dimensional CT to image the vascular anatomy facilitates laparoscopic surgery. T staging of rectal cancer by MRI is an established modality because MRI can diagnose rectal wall laminar structure. N staging in patients with colorectal cancer is still challenging using any imaging modality. MRI is more accurate than CT for the evaluation of liver metastases. PET/CT colonography is valuable in the evaluation of extra-colonic and hepatic disease. PET/CT colonography is useful for obstructing colorectal cancers that cannot be traversed colonoscopically. PET/CT colonography is able to localize synchronous colon cancers proximal to the obstruction precisely. However, there is no definite evidence to support the routine clinical use of PET/CT colonography.},

METHOD: A total of 182 patients were followed for at least five years or until death, with early invasive cancer diagnosed between 1982 and 1989. Patients were grouped according to the level of invasion, as follows: 64 patients with slight carcinoma invasion of the muscularis mucosa (200-300 microns; sm1), 82 with intermediate invasion (sm2), and 36 with carcinoma invasion extending to the inner surface of the muscularis propria (sm3). RESULT: The configuration, diameter, and histologic grade of adenocarcinoma and lymphovascular invasion were correlated with level of invasion. After endoscopic polypectomy or local resection, 4 patients showed local recurrence and 13 patients showed lymph node metastasis. None of these 17 patients had sm1 disease. The level of invasion, configuration, and location were significant risk factors for development of lymph node metastasis or local recurrence (P {$<$} 0.05), but lymphovascular invasion, histologic grade, and diameter were not risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative assessment of the level of invasion using this classification, in which the submucosa is divided into three depths, may decrease the incidence of unnecessary surgery for sessile polyps. Assessment according to the level of invasion is useful in the formulation of appropriate guidelines for the treatment of early invasive cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The preoperative assessment of rectal cancer wall invasion and regional lymph node metastasis is essential for the planning of optimal therapy. This study was done to determine the accuracy and clinical usefulness of transrectal ultrasonography, pelvic computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging in preoperative staging. METHODS: A total of 89 patients with rectal cancer were examined with transrectal ultrasonography (n = 89), pelvic computed tomography (n = 69), and magnetic resonance imaging with endorectal coil (n = 73). The results obtained by these diagnostic modalities were compared with the histopathologic staging of specimens. RESULTS: In staging depth of invasion, the overall accuracy was 81.1 percent (72/89) by transrectal ultrasonography, 65.2 percent (45/ 69) by computed tomography, and 81 percent (59/73) by magnetic resonance imaging. Overstaging was 10 percent (9/89) by transrectal ultrasonography, 17.4 percent (12/69) by computed tomography, and 11 percent (8/73) by magnetic resonance imaging; and understaging was 8 of 89 (8.9 percent) by transrectal ultrasonography, 12 of 69 (17.4 percent) by computed tomography, and 6 of 73 (8 percent) by magnetic resonance imaging. In staging lymph node metastasis, the overall accuracy rate was 54 of 85 (63.5 percent) in transrectal ultrasonography, 39 of 69 (56.5 percent) in computed tomography, and 46 of 73 (63 percent) in magnetic resonance imaging. The sensitivity was 24 of 45 (53.3 percent) in transrectal ultrasonography, 14 of 25 (56 percent) in computed tomography, and 33 of 42 (78.5 percent) in magnetic resonance imaging; and specificity was 30 of 40 (75.0 percent) in transrectal ultrasonography, 25 of 44 (56.8 percent) in computed tomography, and 13 of 31 (41.9 percent) in magnetic resonance imaging. The accuracy in detection of positive lateral pelvic lymph nodes under magnetic resonance imaging (n = 8) was 12.5 percent. The accuracy in detection of posterior vaginal wall invasion was 100 percent in transrectal ultrasonography (n = 7) and 100 percent in magnetic resonance imaging (n = 3), but 28.5 percent in computed tomography (n = 7). CONCLUSIONS: Both transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging with endorectal coil exhibited similar accuracy and were superior to conventional computed tomography in preoperative assessment of depth of invasion and adjacent organ invasion. Because transrectal ultrasonography is a safer and more cost-effective modality than magnetic resonance imaging, transrectal ultrasonography is an appropriate method for preoperative staging of rectal cancer. Further efforts will be needed to provide a better staging of lymph node involvement.},

The purpose of this article is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the diagnostic test accuracy of MRI for detecting extramural venous invasion (EMVI) in patients with colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to November 9, 2018. We included diagnostic accuracy studies that used MRI for EMVI detection in patients with colorectal cancer, using pathologic analysis as the reference standard. The methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled and plotted in a hierarchic summary ROC plot. Metaregression analysis using several clinically relevant covariates was performed. RESULTS. Fourteen studies (n = 1751 patients) were included. Study quality was moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.49-0.71), and pooled specificity was 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.79-0.92). There was substantial heterogeneity according to the Cochran Q test (p {$<$} 0.01) and Higgins I2 heterogeneity index (98\% and 95\% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively). Publication bias was present (p = 0.01). Higher rates of advanced T category, use of high-resolution MRI, and use of antispasmodic drugs were shown to significantly affect heterogeneity (p {$<$} 0.01). Location of primary tumor, preoperative treatment status, study design, definition of reference standard, magnetic field strength, and use of functional MRI were not statistically significant (p = 0.17-0.92). CONCLUSION. MRI shows moderate sensitivity and good specificity for the detection of EMVI in colorectal cancer. The use of high-resolution MRI may improve diagnostic performance.},

Results ENE was more frequent in younger patients and those with rectal cancer, higher T stage, higher N stage, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower in patients with ENE-positive than in those with ENE-negative tumors (DFS, 66.4\% vs. 80.1\%; and OS, 74.8\% vs. 85.6\%, respectively; P {$<$} 0.001 both). In multivariate analysis, pathologic stage, the presence of ENE, LVI, PNI, and no adjuvant chemotherapy were significant independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. There were no statistically significant differences in DFS and OS between ENE-positive stage IIIB tumors and ENE-negative stage IIIC tumors. Materials and Methods The records of 1,948 stage III CRC patients who underwent curative surgery between January 2003 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Conclusions The presence of ENE is independently and significantly associated with lower DFS and OS rates after curative resection for stage III CRC. ENE status should be considered in both the pathologic report and CRC staging system.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: MR staging of nodal metastases in patients with rectal cancer using criteria based on size, shape and signal intensity can be difficult, because {$>$} or =50\% of the nodes are less than 5 mm in size. Therefore new MR criteria were evaluated to see whether it can improve the MR assessment of nodal metastases in rectal cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with primary rectal carcinoma underwent 1.5 T high-resolution MRI with a quadrature phased array coil. Among them, 75 patients who had undergone total mesorectal excision were enrolled in this study. An MR radiologist, blinded for the histological results, randomly recorded the characteristics of each detectable node (LN); common criteria such as short-axis diameter, the ratio of long- to short-axis diameter, and signal intensity on each sequence; new criteria such as the margin (smooth, lobulated, spiculated, indistinct), a homogenous or mottled heterogeneous appearance, gross enhancement and its pattern, the venous encasement, and the dirty perirectal fat signal. RESULTS: Among 75 patients, 22 (29\%) were node-positive. All patients who did not have detectable LN on MR were node-free (n = 15). Presence of LNs {$>$} 4 mm was significantly higher in the node-positive group. Presence of LNs {$>$} 8 mm was seen only in the node-positive group. Presence of a spiculated border and an indistinct border shows sensitivities of 45 and 36\%, and specificities of 100 and 100\%, respectively. Presence of a mottled heterogeneic pattern shows a sensitivity of 50\%, a specificity of 95\%. The presence of these three features were strongly correlated with LN positivity (P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Presence of a venous encasement (n = 4) and dirty perirectal fat signal (n = 3) were also significantly (P {$<$} 0.05, respectively) correlated with LN positivity. CONCLUSION: In addition to size, new criteria such as a spiculated or indistinct border and a mottled heterogeneous appearance could be useful to predict regional lymph node involvement in patients with rectal cancer.},

Transrectal ultrasonography is a new diagnostic modality that has become useful in determining the depth of invasion preoperatively and the presence or absence of metastatic lymph nodes. Transrectal ultrasonography was used in preoperative staging of 36 patients with rectal cancer. Thirty three patients had a radical resection (17 low anterior resection, 15 abdominoperineal resection and 1 pelvic exenteration), one patient had a local excision. Two among these thirty four patients had preoperative radiotherapy. Preoperative transrectal ultrasonographic staging was compared with pathologic findings. In staging depth of invasion, the overall accuracy was 88.8 percent, overstaged in 5.8 percent, understaged in 5.8 percent. Transrectal ultrasonography is the more accurate method than CT in staging of depth of tumor invasion (61.8\% vs 88.8\%). In staging of lymph nodes, the overall accuracy of transrectal ultrasonography was 85.3 percent, sensitivity was 71.7 percent and specificity was 88.8 percent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients (36 male, 14 female) were included in the study. The data from surgical staging were used as reference for comparing the yield of EUS, MRI, and MDCT in preoperative T and N staging of rectal carcinoma. Comparisons were based on the chi-square test. RESULTS: The mean age+SD of the patients were 60±12 years (range; 28-80). The distribution of rectal tumors according to the T and N staging in surgical pathology was as following: T1 (n:2), T2 (n:15), T3 (n:22), T4 (n:11); N0 (n:22), N1-2 (n:28). The accuracy rate of EUS was statistically higher than that of MDCT (92\% vs 64\%; p{$<$}0.01) and that of MRI (92\% vs 72\%; p{$<$}0.01) for T2 tumors. For T3 tumors, EUS had statistically better accuracy of staging compared to MDCT (90\% vs 58\%; p{$<$}0.01) and MRI (90\% vs 60\%; p{$<$}0.01). As for T4 tumors, the accuracy rate of EUS was higher compared to MRI (98\% vs 80\%; p{$<$}0.01). There was no statistical difference in accuracy rates for detection of lymph nodes across the modalities (EUS, 84\%; MDCT 76\%; MRI 70\%; p=not significant). CONCLUSION: EUS appears more accurate in T staging compared to MDCT and MRI in rectal carcinoma. Regarding nodal staging, performance of EUS, MDCT and MRI are similar.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum underwent prospective evaluation with 3-mm axial T2-weighted and USPIO-enhanced T2*-weighted MRI before surgery. Mesorectal nodes visible at in vivo MRI were independently scored by two radiologists as malignant or nonmalignant according to morphologic criteria (irregular nodal contour, heterogeneous signal intensity) on T2-weighted MR images and according to USPIO enhancement pattern on T2*-weighted MR images. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of morphologic and USPIO criteria in identification of malignancy in the pathologically matched mesorectal nodes were compared by use of the McNemar test. Interobserver agreement was compared by use of kappa statistics. RESULTS: After surgery, radiologic-pathologic comparison of 126 mesorectal nodes (116 benign, 10 malignant) was possible. Use of morphologic criteria resulted in an average sensitivity of 65\% (95\% CI, 35-88\%); specificity, 75\% (67-83\%); positive predictive value, 19\% (8-34\%); and negative predictive value, 96\% (91-99\%). Use of USPIO criteria resulted in an average sensitivity of 65\% (95\% CI, 35-88\%); specificity, 93\% (87-96\%); positive predictive value, 43\% (21-67\%); and negative predictive value, 97\% (92-99\%). Use of USPIO MRI improved diagnostic specificity for both observers (p {$<$} 0.01). Interobserver agreement was fair for morphologic criteria (kappa = 0.39) but good for USPIO criteria (kappa = 0.68). CONCLUSION: Use of the pattern of USPIO enhancement had higher diagnostic specificity than but the same sensitivity as morphologic findings in pathologically matched mesorectal lymph nodes.},

This study is a systematic review to evaluate computed tomography (CT), endorectal sonography (ES) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as preoperative staging modalities in rectal cancer. A Medline-based search identifying studies using CT, ES, or MRI in preoperative staging of rectal cancer between 1980 and 1998 was undertaken. The list of papers was supplemented by extensive cross-checking of citation lists. Studies were included if they met predetermined criteria. Data from the accepted studies were entered into pooled tables comparing radiological and pathological staging results for each modality both in determining bowel wall penetration and involvement of lymph nodes. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were determined for the pooled results. Eighty-three studies from 78 papers including 4,897 patients met the inclusion criteria. In determining the wall penetration of the tumour the values for sensitivity for CT, ES, MRI and MRI with endorectal coil were 78\%, 93\%, 86\% and 89\%; for specificity 63\%, 78\%, 77\% and 79\%; and for accuracy 73\%, 87\%, 82\% and 84\%, respectively. In determining the nodal involvement by tumour the sensitivity values for CT, ES, MRI and MRI with endorectal coil 52\%, 71\%, 65\% and 82\%; for specificity 78\%, 76\%, 80\% and 83\%; and for accuracy 66\%, 74\%, 74\% and 82\%, respectively. MRI with an endorectal coil is the single investigation that most accurately predicts pathological stage in rectal cancer.},

An understanding of the technique, anatomy, tumor appearance, and elements of staging on MRI is essential to provide prognostic information and to guide neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical treatment. We provide a framework for imaging the rectum on MRI followed by a practical case-based approach to interpretation of pre-treatment MRI of the rectum in evaluation of rectal cancers, with examples and illustrations of the range of local tumor (T) stage and nodal (N) disease involvement. This approach can be paired with standardized reporting templates to support clear, accurate and clinically relevant imaging assessment of rectal cancers.},

When accurately selected, these complete responders might be considered for less invasive treatments instead of standard surgery. So far, no imaging method has proven reliable. This study was designed to assess the accuracy of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in addition to standard rectal MRI for selection of complete responders after chemoradiation. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer from three university hospitals underwent chemoradiation followed by a restaging MRI (1.5T), consisting of standard T2W-MRI and DWI (b0-1000). Three independent readers first scored the standard MRI only for the likelihood of a complete response using a 5-point confidence score, after which the DWI images were added and the scoring was repeated. Histology (ypT0 vs. ypT1-4) was the standard reference. Diagnostic performance for selection of complete responders and interobserver agreement were compared for the two readings. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 120 patients had a complete response (ypT0). Areas under the ROC-curve for the three readers improved from 0.76, 0.68, and 0.58, using only standard MRI, to 0.8, 0.8, and 0.78 after addition of DWI (P = 0.39, 0.02, and 0.002). Sensitivity for selection of complete responders ranged from 0-40\% on standard MRI versus 52-64\% after addition of DWI. Specificity was equally high (89-98\%) for both reading sessions. Interobserver agreement improved from κ 0.2-0.32 on standard MRI to 0.51-0.55 after addition of DWI. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of DWI to standard rectal MRI improves the selection of complete responders after chemoradiation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in most, but not all, studies. Findings have also been inconclusive with regard to sex and subsite in the colorectum. To resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data on the association between diabetes and the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We identified studies by a literature search of Medline from January 1, 1966, through July 31, 2005, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles. Summary relative risks (RRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Analysis of 15 studies (six case-control and nine cohort studies), including 2 593 935 participants, found that diabetes was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, compared with no diabetes (summary RR of colorectal cancer incidence = 1.30, 95\% CI = 1.20 to 1.40), without heterogeneity between studies (P(heterogeneity) = .21). These results were consistent between case-control and cohort studies and between studies conducted in the United States and in Europe. The association between diabetes and colorectal cancer incidence did not differ statistically significantly by sex (summary RR among women = 1.33, 95\% CI = 1.23 to 1.44; summary RR among men = 1.29, 95\% CI = 1.15 to 1.44; P(heterogeneity) = .26) or by cancer subsite (summary RR for colon = 1.43, 95\% CI = 1.28 to 1.60; summary RR for rectum = 1.33, 95\% CI = 1.14 to 1.54; P(heterogeneity) = .42). Diabetes was positively associated with colorectal cancer mortality (summary RR = 1.26, 95\% CI = 1.05 to 1.50), but there was evidence for heterogeneity between studies (P(heterogeneity) = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support a relationship between diabetes and increased risk of colon and rectal cancer in both women and men.},

Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NACRT) reduces the number of lymph nodes retrieved during surgery. In this study, we evaluated the effect of NACRT on lymph node retrieval and prognosis in patients with LARC. We performed an observational study of 142 patients with LARC. Although our analysis was retrospective, data were collected prospectively. Half the patients were treated with NACRT and total mesorectal excision (TME) and the other half underwent TME only. The number of lymph nodes retrieved and the number of metastatic lymph nodes were significantly reduced in the NACRT group (P\,{$>$}\,0.001). In the univariate and multivariate analyses, only NACRT and patient age were significantly associated with reduced lymph node retrieval. The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the lymph node ratio (LNR) both had a significant effect on prognosis when the patient population was examined as a whole (P\,=\,0.003 and P\,=\,0.001, respectively). However, the LNR was the only significant, independent prognostic factor in both treatment groups (P\,=\,0.007 for the NACRT group; P\,=\,0.04 for the no-NACRT group). NACRT improves patient prognosis only when the number of metastatic lymph nodes is reduced. The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the LNR are important prognostic factors. Lymph node retrieval remains an indispensable tool for staging and prognostic assessment of patients with rectal carcinoma treated with NACRT.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (neoRT/CT) in locally advanced rectal cancer requires an exact initial determination of the depth of the cancerous infiltration (T-status) and of locoregional lymph node metastasis (N-status). For staging and restaging, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is usually used. In specialised centers, the endorectal ultrasound (rES) may be preferred. METHODS: Between January 1998 and May 2001, the T- and N-status of 102 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum ({$>$} or =T3 or N+) was determined prospectively by rES and CT (group I: n=61 without neo-RT/CT, examined once; group II: n=41 examined before and after neoRT/CT). All diagnostic findings were compared using the (y)pTNM-classification. RESULTS: In the patients from group I, the depth of infiltration (uT) was predicted correctly by rES in 75\% and by CT in 48\% of cases; the carcinomas were understaged in 10\% and 41\% of cases and overstaged in 15\% and 11\%, respectively. According to the histopathological findings, the N-status was determined correctly by rES and CT in 75\% and 57\% of cases, understaging occurred in 8\% and 30\% and overstaging in 17\% and 13\%, respectively. In cases in which both methods resulted in identical T- (uT+ctT) or N-staging (uN+ctN), the accuracy increased to 82\% and 80\%, respectively. In patients from group II, after neoRT/CT rES and CT allowed the exact prediction of the yuT-stage in 66\% and 51\%, respectively. Only 2\% were understaged by rES (understaging by CT: 22\%). Overstaging occurred in 32\% and 27\% by rES and CT, respectively. The N-status determined by rES and CT was in accordance with the histopathological findings in 68\% and 76\%of cases, respectively. Understaging occurred in 20\% and 17\%,overstaging in 12\% and 7\%, respectively. Again identical staging results in both rES and CT increased the accuracy of the T- (yuT+yctT) or N- (yuN+yctN) classification to 90\% and 83\%, respectively. In group II, downsizing of the tumor by more than one T-stage was correctly assessed by rES results in 15/20 cases (75\%). A complete remission of initial uT3-carcinoma was diagnosed correctly in only two of eight ypT0-cases. In contrast, CT demonstrated a remission of disease in all cases but was unable to predict the extent of tumour reduction. A remission of lymph node metastasis was accurately shown by rES in 17/19 cases (90\%) and by CT in 10/12 cases (83\%). CONCLUSION: The staging of pretherapeutic, locoregional T- and N-status by rES is superior to that by CT (T-status: P=0.0164, N-status: P=0.0035). At restaging, rES offers higher accuracy in the detection of residual tumour infiltration (but not significantly to CT, yT-status: P=0.0833, yN-status: P=0.7962) and assessment of local remission. Therefore rES should be the method of choice in staging to avoid overtreatment in neoadjuvant settings.After neoRT/CT, the predictive efficacy of the rES for the downsizing/-staging of rectal cancer must be evaluated on greater numbers of patients receiving standardised diagnostic procedures and therapy.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the possibilities of diagnosing abdominal imaging in patients with rectal cancer, detecting lesions and assessing the stage of the lesions, in order to select the appropriate therapy. Before the introduction of imaging technologies, the diagnosis of colorectal pathology was based on conventional methods of inspecting intestines with a barium enema, with either a single or double contrast barium enema. Following the development of endoscopic methods and the wide use of colonoscopy, colonoscopy became the method of choice for diagnosing colorectal diseases. The improvement of Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gave us new possibilities for diagnosing colorectal cancer. For rectal cancer, trans-rectal US (TRUS) or endo-anal US (EAUS) have a significant role. For staging rectal cancer, the Multi Slice Computed Tomography (MSCT) is not the method of choice, but Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is preferred when it comes to monitoring the rectum. The role of the MRI in the T staging of rectal cancer is crucial in preoperative assessment of: thickness - the width of the tumor, the extramural invasion, the circumference of resection margin (CRM), and the assessment of the inclusion of mesorectal fascia. For successful execution of surgical techniques, good diagnostic imaging of the cancer is necessary in order to have a low level of recurrence. According to medical studies, the sensitivity of FDG-PET in diagnosing metastatic nodals is low, but for now it is not recommended in routine diagnosis of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of image preprocessing on radiomic features estimation from computed tomography (CT) imaging of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). CT images of 20 patients with LARC were used to estimate 105 radiomic features of 7 classes (shape, first-order, GLCM, GLDM, GLRLM, GLSZM, and NGTDM). Radiomic features were estimated for 6 different isotropic resampling voxel sizes, using 10 interpolation algorithms (at fixed bin width) and 6 different bin widths (at fixed interpolation algorithm). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated to assess the variability in radiomic features estimation due to preprocessing. A repeated measures correlation analysis was performed to assess any linear correlation between radiomic feature estimate and resampling voxel size or bin width. Reproducibility of radiomic feature estimate, when assessed through ICC analysis, was nominally excellent (ICC {$>$} 0.9) for shape features, good (0.75 {$<$} ICC ≤ 0.9) or moderate (0.5 {$<$} ICC ≤ 0.75) for first-order features, and moderate or poor (0 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.5) for textural features. A number of radiomic features characterized by good or excellent reproducibility in terms of ICC showed however median CV values greater than 15\%. For most textural features, a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) correlation between their estimate and resampling voxel size or bin width was found. In CT imaging of patients with LARC, the estimate of textural features, as well as of first-order features to a lesser extent, is appreciably biased by preprocessing. Accordingly, this should be taken into account when planning clinical or research studies, as well as when comparing results from different studies and performing multicenter studies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic accuracies of MDCT and high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) for regional nodal metastases with different short-axis diameter ranges in rectal cancer patients. METHODS: Rectal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent both MDCT and HR-MRI before surgery were included. The maximum short-axis diameters of the nodes were measured, and were classified as benign or malignant on imaging findings. All of the nodes were subdivided as follows:\,≤\,5~mm (Group A),\,{$>$}\,5~mm and\,≤\,10~mm (Group B) , and\,{$>$}\,10~mm (Group C). The postoperative pathological reports were used as the standard, and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, ROC curve, and AUC value were calculated for each subgroup. RESULTS: A total of 592 nodes were included in the node-to-node evaluation. In Group A, the specificity and accuracy of HR-MRI were significantly higher than those of MDCT (99.28\% vs. 93.99\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001; 95.78\% vs. 89.56\%, P\,=\,0.010; respectively). In Group B, the specificity and accuracy of HR-MRI were also higher than those of MDCT (98.36\% vs. 55.74\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001; 80.45\% vs. 66.17\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001; respectively). For Groups A and B, the AUCs of MDCT were both 0.65, whereas those of HR-MRI were 0.76 and 0.82, respectively. In Group C, all nine malignant nodes were correctly diagnosed metastases on MDCT, whereas one was misjudged as benign on HR-MRI. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of HR-MRI is superior to that of MDCT, with higher specificity, accuracy, and AUC values for HR-MRI than for MDCT.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the usefulness of MRI and PET/CT in nodal staging (N) of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with LARC, who completed their initial staging with PET/CT, between January-20 and March-23. Regional nodes were assessed, and N was determined using both techniques according to TNM criteria. Concordance between MRI and PET/CT was analyzed. The accuracy of both techniques was calculated for those patients who underwent direct surgery. Non-regional pelvic lymph nodes were evaluated by both modalities. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients, 48 were ultimately diagnosed with a locally advanced stage. Of these, 39 underwent neoadjuvant treatment (chemoradiotherapy) followed by surgery, and 9 direct surgery. In 25, the PET/CT extension study revealed distant disease, leading to systemic treatment. Weak concordance was observed between MRI and PET/CT in determining N (k=0.286; p{$<$}0.005). Out of 73 patients, 31(42\%) exhibited concordance, and 42(58\%) showed discordance. In 83\% of the discordant cases, MRI overstaged compared to PET/CT, with 17 cases indicating nodal involvement (N+) by MRI and N0 by PET/CT. Diagnostic accuracy was 78\% for both techniques. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80\%, 75\%, 80\%, and 75\% for MRI, and 60\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 67\%, for PET/CT. PET/CT identified pelvic metastatic adenopathies in 8 patients that were not visible/doubtful by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: In the initial nodal staging of rectal cancer MRI overstages relative to PET/CT.

  abstract = {SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: MRI assessment of rectal cancer not only assesses tumor depth and surgical resectability but also extramural disease which affects prognosis. We have observed that nonnodal tumor nodules (tumor deposits; mrTDs) have a distinct MRI appearance compared to lymph node metastases (mrLNMs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether mrTDs and mrLNMs have different prognostic implications and compare these to other known prognostic markers. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 233 patients undergoing resection for rectal cancer from January 2007 to October 2015. Data were obtained from electronic records and MRIs blindly rereported. Survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic markers were evaluated using Cox regression and competing risks analysis. Inter-observer agreement for mrTD was measured using Cohen Kappa. RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, baseline mrTD/mrEMVI (extramural venous invasion) status was the only significant MRI factor for adverse survival [hazard ratio (HR) 2.36 (1.54-3.61] for overall survival, 2.37 (1.47-3.80) for disease-free survival (both P {$<$} 0.001), superseding T and N categories. mrLNMs were associated with good prognosis (HR 0.50 (0.31-0.80) P = 0.004 for overall survival, 0.60 (0.40-0.90) P = 0.014 for disease-free survival). On multivariable analysis, mrTDs/mrEMVI were strongly associated with distant recurrence (HR 6.53 (2.52-16.91) P ≤ 0.001) whereas T and N category were not. In a subgroup analysis of posttreatment MRIs in postchemoradiotherapy patients, mrTD/mrEMVI status was again the only significant prognostic factor; furthermore those who showed a good treatment response had a prognosis similar to patients who were negative at baseline. Inter-observer agreement for detection of mrTDs was k0.77 and k0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Current MRI staging predicting T and N status does not adequately predict prognosis. Positive mrTD/mrEMVI status has greater prognostic accuracy and would be superior in determining treatment and follow-up protocols. Chemoradiotherapy may be a highly effective treatment strategy in mrTD/mrEMVI positive patients.},

  abstract = {Background Tumour deposits (TDs) are a poor prognostic marker in colorectal cancer, but their significance after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is less certain because this group of patients is excluded in most studies. Post-treatment TD might even be a sign of tumour response. No previous reviews have assessed outcomes in this group. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken according to Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to determine the relevance of post-treatment TD. Inclusion criteria were studies assessing TD in patients who had undergone pre-operative treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy and reporting prevalence and survival outcomes. Studies that did not include histological review of cases were excluded. Results Eight studies and 1283 patients were included in the review. Prevalence of TDs varied from 11.8\% to 44.2\% (mean 23.7\%), similar to untreated patients. The presence of TDs after chemoradiotherapy was associated with invasion depth, lymph node involvement, perineural invasion and synchronous metastases. The pooled hazard ratio for 5-year adverse disease–free survival was 2.3 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8–2.9), and that for overall survival was 2.5 (95\% CI: 1.9–3.3). One study showed a survival benefit with adjuvant therapy in the TD-positive group. Conclusions In analogy with untreated patients, the presence of TDs in patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant treatment is associated with advanced disease and a poor outcome.},

  abstract = {The surgical circumferential resection margin in total mesorectal excision surgery is defined by the relationship of the tumor to the mesorectal fascia. Patients with anticipated tumor invasion of the mesorectal fascia receive neoadjuvant therapy to downstage/downsize the tumor and to obtain tumor-free resection margins.Tumor relationship to the mesorectal fascia is accurately determined by MRI. Compared with MRI, multidetector-row computed tomography is more widely available, faster, less costly, and provides the ability to simultaneously assess the liver, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum for metastases. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of multidetector-row CT with conventional MRI in diagnosis of rectal cancer invasion of the mesorectal fascial envelope. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 2-year period, all patients were enrolled in this study who had biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma and were referred, as a part of the routine preoperative staging workup, for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and also an MRI of the pelvis.All examinations were reviewed independently by 2 radiologists who were blinded from one another, from the findings of the other modality, and from clinical information. Both observers were dedicated abdominal radiologists who are experienced in reading pelvic CT and MRI. Categorical agreement between MRI and multidetector-row CT for all the evaluated parameters of the tumor position, mesorectal fascia, and lymph nodes, as well as the interobserver agreement between CT and MRI, was determined by the intraclass correlation weighted kappa statistic to measure the data set's consistency. RESULTS: Among the study's 92 patients, the tumor characteristics suggested by multidetector-row CT agreed with those of MRI, with a weighted kappa ranging from 0.488 to 0.748 for the first reader and 0.577 to 0.800 for the second reader. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.506 to 0.746.Agreement regarding mesorectal fascia characteristics differed significantly between multidetector-row CT and MRI, depending on the level of assessment. In the distal rectum, agreement was 0.207 for the first reader and 0.385 for the second reader. In the mid rectum, agreement was 0.420 and 0.527, respectively, and in the proximal rectum agreement was 0.508 and 0.520. Interobserver agreement was 0.737 at the distal level and 0.700 at the mid and proximal levels. Agreement regarding measurement of the distance from the tumor to the mesorectal fascia was 0.425 for the first reader and 0.723 for the second reader, with interobserver agreement of 0.766. Agreement in assessment of the number of lymph nodes ranged from 0.743 to 0.787 for the first reader and 0.754 to 0.840 for the second reader. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.779 to 0.841. Agreement in assessment of the size of the lymph nodes ranged from 0.540 to 0.830 for the first reader and 0.850 to 0.940 for the second reader. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.900 to 0.920. Agreement in assessment of the distance from nodes to the mesorectal fascia was 0.320 for the first reader and 0.401 for the second reader, with interobserver agreement of 0.950. CONCLUSION: The results of this study differ from previously published data by demonstrating substantial agreement between readers in multidetector-row CT assessment of the tumor, mesorectal fascia, and lymph nodes. With the exceptions of mesorectal fascia in the distal rectum and the distance from the nodes to mesorectal fascia, other evaluated parameters were assessed with moderate and substantial agreement between multidetector-row CT and MRI. However, our findings suggest that multidetector-row CT does not correlate well enough with MRI findings to replace it in rectal cancer staging.},

Selecting the patients to submit to treatment requires accurate clinical and radiological staging. A team of radiologists, radiotherapists, surgeons, endoscopists and pathologists has been created to stage the patients and to follow the final results. The team have decided the diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. The patients with rectal cancer undergo radiotherapy after staging and are subsequently restaged. If indicated, surgery is performed and histology is compared with restaging, to assess the accuracy of the diagnostic procedures. All diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are made collectively by the team, during scheduled meetings. All data are stored in a computer program. This paper deals with the working method we used, its advantages and the outcome of the first 23 studied patients. Restaging was compared with histology: transrectal US (performed in 8 patients) showed 100\% accuracy in evaluating local tumor spread (T). CT had 91\% accuracy in defining T and 60\% accuracy in N, with a tendency to overstaging. In 78\% of patients {$>$} 50\% reduction of tumor size was observed and the distance from the anal canal increased in 95.5\%. This study will provide the overall accuracy of the clinico-radiologic staging, the survival rates and the indication of prognostic signs.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to compare the restaging results obtained by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after preoperative chemoradiation with pathologic staging of the operative specimen. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, all the consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal cancer that underwent neoadjuvant therapy at our department were evaluated. The results of diagnostic examinations and the definitive pathological examination were considered and compared. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the study (27 males, 73\%), mean age was 65.5 years (range 45–82 years). In all the patients TRUS and CT and in 20 patients MRI were performed before and after the treatment. Concerning the depth of invasion after treatment TRUS agreed with histopathology in 25/37 patients (67.5\%), CT agreed in 22/ 37 cases (59.5\%), and MRI in 12/20 cases (60\%). Considering only neoplasia with stage T3, TRUS agreed in 23/24 cases (96\%), CT in 19 cases (79\%), and MRI in 10/12 cases (83.5\%). Considering the tumors that did not exceed the rectal wall (T0, T1, and T2), TRUS agreed with histology in 2/13 cases (15.5\%),CTin 3/13 cases (23\%), andMRI 2/8 cases (25\%). Concerning the presence of positive lymph nodes TRUS agreed with histology in 28/37 cases (75.5\%), while CT agreed in 21/37 cases (56.5\%) and MRI in 11/20 cases (55\%). The concordance between the techniques was found to be low. CONCLUSIONS: Transrectal ultrasonography resulted as the most accurate method to determine neoplastic wall infiltration and lymph node involvement even after radiochemotherapy. In most cases, considering the poor correlation between the diagnostic procedures and the disagreement of the results, a restaging performed only with TRUS could be proposed, limiting the use of the other imaging methods to selected cases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that MRI may be used as the sole modality of choice in pre-operative staging in rectal cancers. Knowledge of tumour stage and a threatened Circumferential Resection Margin (CRM) pre-operatively are essential for planning neo-adjuvant therapy and as predictors of local recurrence. At present most units utilize CT scanning to assess these parameters. The aim of our study was two fold: firstly to examine the accuracy of preop CT and MRI staging of rectal cancers compared with final histology and secondly to assess the accuracy of MRI in predicting penetration of the mesorectal envelope (ME). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma underwent thin slice MRI and CT scan pre-operatively. Forty-seven patients have been prospectively entered into the study: 24 male (median age 68 years; range 38-91 years). Eleven patients were unsuitable for surgery leaving 36 patients available for study. RESULTS: CT correctly staged patients with T1/T2 rectal cancers more often than MRI (77\% vs. 43\%, P = 0.226). Patients with T1/T2 tumours were overstaged more often by MRI compared with CT (54\% vs. 23\%, P = 0.226). A greater proportion of patients with T3 tumours were correctly staged by MRI than CT (76\% vs. 41\%, P = 0.08); and more T3 disease was understaged by CT than MRI (54 vs. 18\%, P = 0.032). CT and MRI staged T4 disease equally. In the assessment of mesorectal envelope integrity, MRI had a sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 84\%. The positive predictive value was 44\% and the negative predictive value 96\%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest significant differences between accurate pre-operative "T" staging by CT and MRI for rectal cancer. MRI has the potential however, to accurately assess mesorectal envelope invasion. Further analysis is required to assess whether MRI can be used as the sole modality in pre-operative staging of rectal cancers.},

So far, there has been no published study on this modality in patients with rectal carcinoma. METHODS: Twenty patients with rectal carcinoma were preoperatively examined by MDCT and conventional CT (CCT). Diagnostic accuracies of both modalities were compared regarding the evaluation of depth of tumor invasion (Tis/T1/T2, T3, T4) and lymph node metastasis based on the pathologic findings. RESULTS: Although CCT detected a tumor in 13 (65\%) of 20 patients, MDCT revealed a tumor in all 20 patients (P = 0.004). Regarding depth of tumor invasion, the concordance rate was significantly higher for MDCT (20/20: 100\%) than for CCT (12 of 20: 60\%; P = 0.002). Regarding lymph node metastasis, the overall accuracy was 70.0\% in CCT, and also 70.0\% in MDCT. CONCLUSIONS: MDCT was superior to CCT in the evaluation of depth of tumor invasion, but was equal to CCT in the evaluation of lymph node metastasis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in depicting the extramural depth of tumor invasion in patients who have rectal cancer, with histopathologic results as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Rectal Cancer European Equivalence (MERCURY) Study received ethics approval from all participating centers, and all patients gave informed consent. Consecutive patients (n = 679) with adenocarcinoma of the rectum consented to participate. Imaging workshops for participating specialist gastrointestinal radiologists were held to ensure standardization of image acquisition techniques. Standardized MR image interpretation and data reporting were performed by using previously validated criteria. MR images were prospectively singly read by the specialist gastrointestinal radiologists. The maximal extramural depth (EMD) of tumor spread, defined at histopathologic analysis as the distance from the outer edge of the longitudinal muscularis propria to the outer edge of the tumor, was measured and recorded. The maximal EMD was the reference standard. The MR and histopathologic results were considered to be equivalent when the 95\% confidence interval of the difference between them was within +/-0.5 mm. RESULTS: Tumor EMD measurements obtained at both MR imaging and histopathologic analysis were available for 295 (95\%) of 311 patients after primary surgery. Mean EMDs were 2.80 mm +/- 4.60 (standard deviation) and 2.81 mm +/- 4.28 at MR imaging and histopathologic analysis, respectively. The mean difference between the MR-derived and histopathologically derived EMDs was -0.05 mm +/- 3.85 (95\% confidence interval: -0.49 mm, 0.40 mm). Therefore, MR and histopathologic assessments of tumor spread were considered equivalent to within 0.5 mm. CONCLUSION: Demonstration of accurate measurement of the depth of extramural tumor spread in the MERCURY Study enabled accurate preoperative prognostication.},

  abstract = {Venous invasion, or "large vessel" invasion, is a known independent prognostic indicator of distant recurrence and survival in colorectal cancer. Accurate assessment of venous invasion is of particular importance in stage II disease because it may influence the decision to administer adjuvant therapy. Venous invasion is widely believed to be an underreported finding with significant variability in its reported incidence. In the most recent College of American Pathologists' cancer reporting protocol, venous invasion is not recorded separately from lymphovascular, or "small vessel" invasion, which may not be appropriate because these features confer differing prognostic information. The presence of extramural venous invasion is strongly predictive of adverse outcome, although the prognostic significance of intramural venous invasion remains unknown. There are no formal guidelines regarding the pathologic assessment of venous invasion or the application of specific reporting criteria. The routine use of an elastic stain results in an almost 3-fold increase in the venous invasion detection rate when compared with a standard hematoxylin and eosin stain and may be a cost-effective means of increasing the diagnostic yield of venous invasion. The development of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, where extramural venous invasion can be detected preoperatively, may also influence the manner in which pathologists process specimens. This review focuses on recent developments in the assessment of venous invasion and highlights their potential impact on future practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis is important in determining the optimal therapy for rectal cancer. It has been shown that diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a useful tool for detecting malignant tumors. METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients with rectal cancer were examined with DWI + conventional (T1-weighted and T2-weighted) MRI and computed tomography (CT). All 129 patients underwent rectal resection with total mesorectal excision. Findings on DWI + conventional MRI and CT were compared with those from histopathologic examinations. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (46\%) patients had metastatic lymph nodes on histopathologic examinations. Two hundred twenty (18\%) of 1,250 lymph nodes were pathologically positive for tumor metastasis. The overall patient-based sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of DWI + conventional MRI were 93, 81, 81, 93, and 87\%, respectively. Corresponding values of CT were 73, 79, 74, 77, and 76\%, respectively. The overall node-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of DWI + conventional MRI were 97, 81, 52, 99, and 84\%, respectively. Corresponding values of CT were 86, 80, 48, 96, and 81\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DWI + conventional MRI is effective for the detection of lymph node metastasis and useful for selection of the optimal therapy for rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of computed tomography (CT) texture analysis in the diagnosis of lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) metastasis of rectal cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 45 patients with rectal cancer who underwent surgery with LPLN dissection at Tokushima University Hospital from January 2017 to December 2021. The texture analysis of the LPLNs was performed on preoperative CT images, and 18 parameters were calculated. The correlation between each parameter and pathological LPLN metastasis was evaluated. The texture parameters were compared between pathologically metastasis-positive LPLNs and metastasis-negative LPLNs. RESULTS: A total of 40 LPLNs were extracted from 25 patients by preoperative CT scans. No LPLNs could be identified in the remaining 19 patients. Eight of the 25 patients had pathologically positive LPLN metastasis. Extracted LPLNs were analyzed by the texture analysis. Pathologically metastasis-positive LPLNs had significantly lower mean Hounsfield unit, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) energy, and GLCM Entropy\_log2 values, and a significantly larger volume than pathologically metastasis-negative LPLNs. Multivariate analysis revealed that the independent predictive factors for LPLN metastasis were volume (a conventional parameter) (odds ratio 7.81, 95\% confidence interval 1.42-43.1, p value 0.018) and GLCM Entropy\_log2 (a texture parameter) (odds ratio 12.7, 95\% confidence interval 1.28-126.0, p value 0.030). The combination of both parameters improved the diagnostic specificity while maintaining the sensitivity compared with each parameter alone. CONCLUSION: Combining the CT texture analysis with conventional diagnostic imaging may increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of LPLN metastasis of rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Rectal cancer is a common and serious disease in the Western hemisphere. Optimal treatment of rectal cancer involves a multidisciplinary approach, with collaboration required between radiologists, oncologists, surgeons, and pathologists to achieve local control and decrease the rate of recurrence. Several studies have been published that show the ability to accurately stage rectal cancer with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Moreover, advances in preoperative therapies require accurate preoperative staging with MR imaging to select those patients who may benefit from more intensive treatment, without subjecting those who will not benefit to unnecessary treatment. As we enter an era of individualized patient care, stratified according to the risk of both local and distant failure, imaging takes on the same importance as the tumor type and genetic susceptibility. MR imaging is now an essential tool to enable the oncology team to make appropriate treatment decisions. However, rectal cancer evaluation with MR imaging remains a challenge in the hands of nonexperts. This article describes a mnemonic device, "DISTANCE," to enable a systematic approach to the interpretation of MR images, thereby enabling all the clinically relevant features to be adequately assessed: DIS, for Distance from the Inferior part of the tumor to the transitional Skin; T, for T staging; A, for Anal complex; N, for Nodal staging; C, for Circumferential resection margin; and E, for Extramural vascular invasion.},

METHODS: cTN stages and the distance between tumour and mesorectal fascia (MRF) were compared with histopathological findings in 1168 patients who underwent radical resection without neoadjuvant treatment. Data were registered prospectively from 2006 to 2014. RESULTS: Agreement between clinical and histopathological TN stages was 50\%, independent of tumour location. Inter-hospital variability was within 99\% prediction limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was increasingly applied, but staging accuracy did not improve. Stage II-III was correctly predicted in 69\% and pStage I was over-staged in 35\%. The positive predictive value of endorectal ultrasonography (ERUS) for T1 lesions was 57\%. MRI-based distances to MRF correlated poorly with the circumferential resection margin (r\,=\,0.26). A negative resection margin was achieved in 91\% when the distance to the MRF was {$>$}1\,mm. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of rectal cancer staging in general practice should be improved to avoid under- or overtreatment. Training and expert review of pre-treatment MR imaging could be helpful. A second ERUS is justified when transanal local resection for early lesions is planned.},

RESULTS: TRUS identified wall invasion in all ten cases and perirectal fat infiltration in all five cases in whom these were present. Node involvement was detected in five cases on TRUS and two of six cases on CT. Metastasis to bladder (one case) was not recognized by TRUS but was seen on CT. CONCLUSION: TRUS is inexpensive and superior to CT in staging early rectal carcinoma; limited depth of penetration is its major limitation. CT is useful for the diagnosis of advanced disease.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a very common malignancy in the Western World and despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy and screening, it is still the second leading cause of cancer deaths in this part of the world. Numerous factors are found important in the development of CRC including colonocyte metabolism, high risk luminal environment, inflammation, as well as lifestyle factors such as diet, tobacco, and alcohol consumption. In recent years focus has turned towards the genetics and molecular biology of CRC and several interesting and promising correlations and pathways have been discovered. The major genetic pathways of CRC are the Chromosome Instability Pathway representing the pathway of sporadic CRC through the K-ras, APC, and P53 mutations, and the Microsatellite Instability Pathway representing the pathway of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer through mutations in mismatch repair genes. To identify early cancers, screening programs have been initiated, and the leading strategy has been the use of faecal occult blood testing followed by colonoscopy in positive cases. Regarding the treatment of colorectal cancer, significant advances have been made in the recent decade. The molecular targets of CRC include at least two important cell surface receptors: the epidermal growth factor receptor and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. The genetic and molecular knowledge of CRC has widen the scientific and clinical perspectives of diagnosing and treatment. However, despite significant advances in the understanding and treatment of CRC, results from targeted therapy are still not convincing. Future studies will determine the role for this new treatment modality.},

They are derived from the epithelium and are considered to be among the most frequently detected cancers. They are known to occur in approximately 5 \% population of the Western world. After metastasis, a patient's 5-year postsurgical survival chances unfortunately fall from 90 to 10 \% or even less. Adenocarcinoma, the most common cell type of colon cancer, alone constitutes 95 \% of the cases. Lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma can also be found in some cases. Because 5 \% of persons are predisposed to development of colorectal cancer, this disease has often been addressed as an important public health issue. Factors that are known in particular to increase a person's risk to develop this cancer are as follows: an individual's age, dietary habits, any complaint of obesity, diabetes, previous history of cancer or intestinal polyps, personal habit of alcohol consumption and smoking, family history of colon cancer, race, sex, and ethnicity. Since the risk of colorectal cancer is increasing steadily in Kashmir, India, like in some other corners of Asia, exhaustive efforts are being made to find the association of above given and other risk factors with the development of this gastrointestinal tract cancer. Adoption of Western life style, diet mimicry, together with a habit of having physically inactive life style and consumption of red meat in particular can be blamed as being active players to a considerable extent.},

The results obtained have not been considered satisfactory and it is felt that US, CT and MR should not be employed routinely for rectal staging. Indeed accuracy of US, CT and MR is respectively 64\%, 75\% and 81\% in the T evaluation and 64\%, 70\% and 64\% in the N staging. In order to evaluate the effective usefulness of these three latter imaging techniques a double therapeutical choice was proposed. The first treatment option was suggested on the basis of traditional staging while a second choice was given considering US, TC and MR data also. Operatory findings subsequently allowed a definitive judgement on the influence of the different techniques on treatment selection. US has furnished useful data that could have allowed us to modify treatment in one case while in 5 other cases diagnostic error would have influenced treatment negatively. CT was useful in 5 cases while in 7 cases it would have influenced treatment choice negatively. MR would have been useful in one case and harmful in another. It is concluded that only patients with large neoplasms (stages T3 and T4) benefit from CT and MR staging with the exception of those cases that have tumors above the peritoneal fold or in strict relation with the sphincter structures. US was useful only in evaluating relations of neoplasms of the anterior rectal wall with nearby pelvic structures.},

  abstract = {The use of modern techniques of imaging in the postoperative follow-up is reported to allow an earlier diagnosis of local recurrence in patients operated on with anterior resection for rectal cancer and, consequently, to allow a higher percentage of local recurrence resection to be performed. Although intrarectal ultrasound (IU) has proved highly reliable in preoperative staging, its value in relapse detection has been investigated only in retrospective studies and rarely compared with that of computed tomography (CT). The present prospective study aims at evaluating the role of IU vs. CT in the diagnosis of local recurrence and at verifying whether an earlier diagnosis and a higher resectability rate of recurrence result in an acceptable long-term survival. Thirty-seven patients who had undergone low and ultralow anterior resection for rectal cancer (anastomosis within 10 cm of the anal verge) were investigated prospectively. All the patients have been followed up by IU and CT at predetermined intervals. Six local recurrences were detected. CT correctly identified all the local recurrences (sensitivity = 100 percent, specificity = 93 percent, and accuracy = 94.5 percent); IU correctly identified only four of six local recurrences (sensitivity = 66.6 percent, specificity = 93 percent, and accuracy = 89 percent). Four patients with local recurrence underwent surgical treatment (resectability rate = 66.6 percent). Abdominoperineal resection in three patients and Hartmann's procedure in one patient were performed. In the other two patients, extensive metastatic liver involvements contraindicated surgery. All the resected patients were alive after one year; two of them are disease free, and the other two experienced recurrent disease. In conclusion, CT seems to have a higher sensitivity and accuracy in relapse detection. The increase in the local recurrence resectability rate does not result in a significant improvement in long-term survival. However, the good quality of life justifies the high cost of an intensive follow-up and a more aggressive surgical approach.},

Sonography correctly staged 20 of 23 tumours with two false negatives and one false positive, while CT correctly staged 19 of 23 tumours with two false negatives and two false positives. The results of ultrasound were found to be as accurate as those of CT; the low cost and simple use of ultrasound makes it preferable in the pre-operative assessment of the depth of invasion of rectal cancer. In addition, intrarectal ultrasound was routinely performed in 42 patients, operated on for rectal cancer by means of sphincter-saving procedures, at variable intervals in the first 2 years postoperatively. Eight local recurrences were recognized and confirmed by CT. Based on the low cost, reliability and simple use, intrarectal ultrasound is proposed as first examination for local recurrence detection in the follow-up of patients with low anterior resection for rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Low rectal cancers ({$<$}5 cm from the anal verge), compared with all others, have greater positive resection margin rates, attributed to mesorectal tapering and higher perforation risk. The aim of this study was to assess positive resection margin prediction by using magnetic resonance imaging staging. METHODS: The following features were analyzed by using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging from 101 consecutive patients with low rectal tumors: tumor location (posterior/anterior) and magnetic resonance stage (Stage 1-2, tumor within the intersphincteric plane; Stage 3-4 tumor extending into the intersphincteric plane). Magnetic resonance imaging tumor regression grade was measured where posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging was available and compared with histopathologic findings. RESULTS: Seventy of 101 patients had abdominoperineal excisions, and 31 of 101 had low anterior resections. Using logistic regression, positive resection margin odds were higher for magnetic resonance Stages 3 to 4 than Stages 1 to 2 by a factor of 17.7 (P {$<$} 0.001), and positive resection margin odds were higher by a factor of 2.8 for anterior vs. posterior tumors (P = 0.026). Magnetic resonance imaging tumor regression grade strongly predicted for positive resection margins; 11 of 15 patients with little treatment response had positive resection margins, compared with 2 of 15 with {$>$}50 percent complete treatment response on magnetic resonance imaging (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Significant magnetic resonance imaging positive resection margin predictors are tumor into or beyond the intersphincteric plane and magnetic resonance imaging tumor regression grade.},

METHODOLOGY: The subjects were 52 patients with colon cancer and 30 patients with rectal cancer who underwent transabdominal US and curative surgery. During endoscopy, we applied transabdominal US by filling the area around the tumor with de-gassed water. The accuracy of depth invasion assessment using EGTUS was compared with that using endoscopic, computed tomography (CT), surgical or histological findings. RESULTS: The tumor detection rate was 75.6\% (62/82), 88.5\% (46/52) for colon cancer and 53.3\% (16/30) for rectal cancer. The diagnostic accuracies of EGTUS, endoscopic, CT and surgical findings were 87.1\% (54/62), 73.2\% (60/82), 66.7\% (46/69), 65.9\% (54/82), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of EGTUS was 100\% (2/2), 66.7\% (4/6), and 90.0\% (44/49) for T1, T2 and T3 cancer, respectively.

This study was designed to determine the impact of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration on the staging and management of rectal carcinoma and to compare the staging accuracy of computed tomography scan, endoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. METHODS: The records of 60 consecutive patients diagnosed with rectal carcinoma referred for endoscopic ultrasound staging were reviewed. Computed tomography scans, endoscopic ultrasound imaging, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration staging, surgical pathology, and subsequent treatment were compared. RESULTS: Of 48 patients who underwent computed tomography scan imaging, the additional information provided by endoscopic ultrasound changed management in 38 percent of patients. Sixteen patients identified as having nonjuxtatumoral lymph nodes underwent fine-needle aspiration and the additional information obtained changed therapy in three (19 percent) of these patients. All five cases of recurrent rectal carcinoma were correctly diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration. Tumor staging accuracy was 45 percent (computed tomography) and 89 percent (endoscopic ultrasound; P{$<$}0.0001); nodal staging accuracy was 68 percent (computed tomography), 85 percent (endoscopic ultrasound), and 92 percent (endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration; P=not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic ultrasound imaging was better than computed tomography scanning at overall tumor staging, whereas endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration demonstrated a trend toward more accurate nodal staging. Preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasound resulted in a change of management in 38 percent of patients. The addition of fine-needle aspiration changed the management in 19 percent of those who underwent nonjuxtatumoral lymph node sampling. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration accurately diagnosed 100 percent of those with recurrent rectal carcinoma. Clearly, endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration are important for the staging and management of rectal carcinoma and for detecting disease recurrence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low rectal cancers are associated with worse outcomes in comparison with mid and upper rectal tumors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the predictive accuracy of MRI in identifying the correct surgical approach based on the mesorectal and extralevator planes. DESIGN: This study involved the retrospective analysis of MRI and histopathology data of 33 patients with low rectal cancer, with the use of an anatomically based staging system. Three radiologists reported on the available surgical planes of excision based on the predicted relationship of tumor to key anatomical features. MRI-predicted planes of excision were then compared with the histopathological planes actually required, with the use of the same staging criteria. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at 4 English district general hospitals. PATIENTS: Unselected patients with low rectal cancer, all of whom were participants in a multicenter study, were eligible for this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: : The main outcome measured was the accuracy of operative plane prediction on MRI. RESULTS: : On pathological analysis, the mesorectal plane would have been sufficient to achieve a clear margin in 28 of 33 (84.9\%) of cases. The extralevator plane was required in 5 of 33 (15.1\%). Planes were correctly predicted by MRI in 29 of 33 cases by radiologist 1 and 24 of 33 cases by radiologists 2 and 3 with an accuracy of 87.9\% and 72.7\%. Overstaging (extralevator plane predicted when a mesorectal plane would have sufficed) occurred in 3 of 33 and 7 of 33 cases. Understaging (mesorectal plane predicted when an extralevator plane was required) occurred in 1 of 33 and 2 of 33 cases. The positive and negative predictive values of MRI in determining the histopathological plane of excision required were 57\% and 96\% for radiologist 1 and 30\% and 91\% for radiologists 2 and 3. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature and its relatively small patient numbers. No account was taken of postoperative function when recommending the surgical plane. CONCLUSIONS: This supports an anatomically based MRI staging system for low rectal cancer to predict the planes of surgical excision. This may help to reduce margin positivity and to improve outcome in patients with low rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {AIM: Although magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is widely used for rectal cancer staging, many centres in the UK perform computed tomography (CT) for staging rectal cancer at present. Furthermore in a small proportion of cases contraindications to MR imaging may lead to staging using CT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of current generation multidetector row CT (MDCT) in local staging of rectal cancer. In particular the accuracy of multiplanar (MPR) versus axial images in the staging of rectal cancer was assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients were identified who had undergone staging of rectal cancer on CT. The imaging data were reviewed as axial images and then as MPR images (coronal and sagittal) perpendicular and parallel to the tumour axis. CT staging on axial and MPR images was then compared to histopathological staging. RESULTS: MPR images detected more T4 and T3 stage tumours than axial images alone. The overall accuracy of T-staging on MPR images was 87.1\% versus 73.0\% for axial images alone. The overall accuracy of N staging on MPR versus axial images was 84.8\% versus 70.7\%. There was a statistically significant difference in the staging of T3 tumours between MPR and axial images (p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSION: Multidetector row CT has high accuracy for local staging of rectal cancer. Addition of MPR images to standard axial images provides higher accuracy rates for T and N staging of rectal cancer than axial images alone.},

Tumor extension and the presence of perirectal lymph nodes were evaluated separately and independently in all three CT sequences according to the TNM classification. All patients had surgical follow-up and the CT scans were compared to the surgical and histopathological findings. There was no significant difference in diagnostic outcome in the three CT procedures. Information obtained by frontal and lateral scout views were compared, and the lateral scout view proved more informative than the frontal scout view. For staging rectal carcinoma, narrow slice scanning and intravenous contrast media are superfluous and should be reserved for special cases. We recommend the use of lateral scout views.},

There is no standard definition of a predicted safe margin on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to assess which cut-off (1, 2 or 5 mm) was the best predictor of local recurrence based on preoperative MRI assessment of the circumferential resection margin (CRM). METHODS: Data were collected prospectively on the distance between the tumour and mesorectal fascia for patients with documented radiological margin status in the MERCURY study. Positive margin and local recurrence rates were compared for MRI distances from the tumour to the mesorectal fascia of 1 mm or less, more than 1 mm up to 2 mm, more than 2 mm up to 5 mm, and more than 5 mm. The Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to determine the effect of level of margin involvement on time to local recurrence. RESULTS: Univariable analysis showed that, relative to a distance measured by MRI of more than 5 mm, the hazard ratio (HR) for local recurrence was 3·90 (95 per cent confidence interval 1·99 to 7·63; P {$<$} 0·001) for a margin of 1 mm or less, 0·81 (0·36 to 1·85; P = 0·620) for a margin of more than 1 mm up to 2 mm, and 0·33 (0·10 to 1·08; P = 0·067) for a margin greater than 2 mm up to 5 mm. Multivariable analysis of the effect of MRI distance to the mesorectal fascia and preoperative treatment on local recurrence showed that a margin of 1 mm or less remained significant regardless of preoperative treatment (HR 3·72, 1·43 to 9·71; P = 0·007). CONCLUSION: For preoperative staging of rectal cancer, the best cut-off distance for predicting CRM involvement using MRI is 1 mm. Using a cut-off greater than this does not appear to identify patients at higher risk of local recurrence.},

This follow-up study of 374 patients with rectal cancer reports the relationship between preoperative MRI assessment of CRM staging, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stage, and clinical variables with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to local recurrence (LR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent protocol high-resolution pelvic MRI. Tumor distance to the mesorectal fascia of ≤ 1 mm was recorded as an MRI-involved CRM. A Cox proportional hazards model was used in multivariate analysis to determine the relationship of MRI assessment of CRM to survivorship after adjusting for preoperative covariates. RESULTS: Surviving patients were followed for a median of 62 months. The 5-year OS was 62.2\% in patients with MRI-clear CRM compared with 42.2\% in patients with MRI-involved CRM with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.97 (95\% CI, 1.27 to 3.04; P {$<$} .01). The 5-year DFS was 67.2\% (95\% CI, 61.4\% to 73\%) for MRI-clear CRM compared with 47.3\% (95\% CI, 33.7\% to 60.9\%) for MRI-involved CRM with an HR of 1.65 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 2.69; P {$<$} .05). Local recurrence HR for MRI-involved CRM was 3.50 (95\% CI, 1.53 to 8.00; P {$<$} .05). MRI-involved CRM was the only preoperative staging parameter that remained significant for OS, DFS, and LR on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: High-resolution MRI preoperative assessment of CRM status is superior to AJCC TNM-based criteria for assessing risk of LR, DFS, and OS.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To audit the accuracy with which pre-operative MRI and multi-detector row CT determine the relationship between rectal tumour and the circumferential resection margin (CRM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR and CT scans of 72 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were retrieved. The relationship between tumour and the mesorectal fascia was determined by two observers, who classified appearances into three categories: no tumour within 5 mm of the mesorectal fascia; tumour within 5 mm of the mesorectal fascia ('threatened' margin); tumour at the mesorectal fascia ('involved' margin). Agreement with post-operative histopathology was assessed by Kappa statistics. RESULTS: There was poor agreement between both MRI and CT, and post-operative histology, both in all 72 patients and in the 42 who had received no pre-operative therapy or short-course radiotherapy only. Both imaging modalities had a tendency to overstage patients whose CRM was uninvolved subsequently. However, the negative predictive value for an uninvolved margin was 81.8\% by MRI and 84.6\% by CT. There was no patient with an involved margin by histopathology whose imaging had suggested the margin was uninvolved. CONCLUSION: Both pre-operative MRI and multi-detector row CT have high negative predictive values for a subsequently uninvolved resection margin.},

  abstract = {The role of conventional CT scan and conventional MR imaging in assessing patients with colorectal tumors is now well established. Because both techniques have an unacceptably low accuracy for identifying the early stages of primary colorectal cancers (T1, T2N0 or N1 and early T3N0 or N1, or Dukes stage A, B1 and 2, and C1), their routine use for preoperative staging is not recommended. This low staging accuracy is related to the fact that neither method can assess the depth of tumor infiltration within the bowel wall and both have difficulty in diagnosing malignant adenopathy. These distinctions are necessary in order to determine correctly patient prognosis and tumor resectability. If the various publications on CT scan and MR imaging staging of primary colon tumors are summarized, a mean overall accuracy of approximately 70\% can be established. The sensitivity for lymph node detection of malignant lymphadenopathy is only about 45\%. The sensitivity for detection of positive lymph nodes is better for rectal tumors because any adenopathy in the perirectal area can be considered malignant because benign adenopathy is not seen in this area. For the early stages of colon cancer or recurrent tumor at the anastomotic site, endoscopic ultrasound or TRUS is the method of choice. Both TRUS and MR imaging with endorectal coils can demonstrate the various layers of the rectal wall, but the ultrasonographic examination can be performed at lower cost and is less time-consuming. Despite these limitations CT scan and MR imaging are useful for assessing patients suspected of having extensive disease, including invasion of fat or neighboring organs or metastatic spread to distant sites including, liver, adrenals, lung, and so forth. CT scan and MR imaging are also helpful in the following ways: in determining whether a patient will benefit from preoperative radiation or whether a patient with rectal cancer can undergo a sphincter-saving procedure; for designing radiation ports; and for detecting complications related to the neoplasm, such as perforation with abscess formation or preobstructive ischemia in patients with complete obstruction by tumor. In these cases, management often is based on CT scan and MR imaging findings and cross-sectional follow-up studies can establish the success of treatment. CT scan and MR imaging have a premier role in the detection of recurrent colorectal cancer. CT scan and MR imaging are superior to colonoscopy for diagnosing extrinsic mass-like tumor recurrences and they are the only methods by which patients with total AP resection can be fully evaluated. The overall accuracy of CT scan and MR imaging for detecting recurrent colorectal tumors ranges from 90\% to 95\%. Following AP resection, CT scan cannot reliably determine whether a soft tissue density in the surgical bed represents recurrent tumor, and it is important to obtain CT scan baseline studies 4 months after surgery and to repeat this examination at 6-month intervals. Scar tissue, even if initially masslike, shrinks over time and after 1 year should be smaller and its margins more sharply defined. Any apparent increase in size of a mass or any demonstration of adenopathy must be considered an indication for biopsy. Recurrent tumors that do not extend to the pelvis or abdominal sidewalls or invade bone or nerves can be resected. Subtle tumor recurrence or tumor foci in small nodes can be detected by PET scan and immunoscintigraphy, but their future role in the diagnostic imaging of colorectal cancer patients depends on the results of ongoing studies. Helical CT scan has the advantages of fast volume scanning associated with optimal bolus delivery, absence of artifacts related to motion, absence of missed slices, and availability of reformations in multiple planes and three-dimensional reconstruction (virtual reality). The role of this technique in patients with colorectal neoplasms has not been defined. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

Imagistic paraclinical exams must bring data about tumor relation with the rectal wall and the mesorectal fascia, the lymph nodes and other important structures invasion. In this purpose it was used a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (IRM) and computed tomography (CT) comparatively with surgical findings and pathological results on 15 patients with benign and malignant rectal neoplasia, 6 men and 9 females. We apreciate that computed tomography is the choice for imagistic approach of urinary system, mesorectal nodes and uterus and that IRM is best in imagistic evaluation of anterior subperitoneal structures and mesorectal fascia. In these cases association of the IRM exam with spiral CT provides best results concerning tumoral staging.},

The study population consisted of 50 patients with histologically proven rectal cancer. A CT scan was also performed on 45 patients, and the results were then compared to postoperative histologic findings. Endorectal US allowed the correct staging of 39/45 tumors (86.6\%) with 1 false positive (over-staging T1 as T2), and 5 false negatives (under-staging 3 x T3 as T2; 2 x T4 as T3). CT allowed the correct staging of 37/45 tumors (82.2\%), with 5 false positives (overstaging T1 as T2) and 3 false negatives (understaging T3 as T2). Our results prove endorectal US to be a reliable method for the local staging of rectal cancers, limited to mucosa, submucosa and muscular layers of the rectal wall (T1 and T2 tumors). CT does not allow proper evaluation of T1 and T2 tumors, but provides with a better assessment of tumors involving perirectal fat and adjacent structures (T3 and T4). Both CT and endorectal US should, therefore, be used as complementary diagnostic techniques for an accurate evaluation of the local extension of lower rectal cancers.},

This study aims to assess the methodological quality and reporting quality of systematic reviews and to determine which diagnostic imaging techniques is the optimal modality for the diagnosis of lymph node involvement in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature to identify relevant studies from inception to June 2018. We will include systematic reviews that evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic imaging techniques for lymph node involvement. The methodological quality will be assessed using AMASAR checklist, and the reporting quality will be assessed using PRISMA-DTA checklist. The pairwise meta-analysis and indirect comparisons will be performed using STATA V.12.0. RESULTS: The results of this overview will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-resolution MRI is regarded as the best method to evaluate whether there is an involved circumferential resection margin in rectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: We explored the application of the faster region-based convolutional neural network to identify positive circumferential resection margins in high-resolution MRI images. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study. SETTINGS: The study conducted at a single surgical unit of a public university hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 240 patients with rectal cancer in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from July 2016 to August 2018, who were determined to have a positive circumferential resection margin and who had received a high-resolution MRI. All posttreatment cases were excluded from this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The faster region-based convolutional neural network was trained by 12,258 transverse relaxation-weighted (T2-weighted imaging) images of pelvic high-resolution MRI to build an artificial intelligence platform and complete clinical tests. In this network, the proportion of positive and negative circumferential resection margin images was 1:2. In accordance with the test results of the validation group, the metrics of the receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve were applied to compare the diagnostic results of the artificial intelligence platform with those of senior radiology experts. RESULTS: In this artificial intelligence platform, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the circumferential resection margin status as determined were 0.932, 0.838, and 0.956. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.953. The time required to automatically recognize an image was 0.2 seconds. LIMITATIONS: This is a single-center retrospective study with limited data volume and a highly selected patient cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In high-resolution MRI images of rectal cancer before treatment, the application of faster region-based convolutional neural network to segment the positive circumferential resection margin has high accuracy and feasibility.

Todos los casos posteriores al tratamiento fueron excluidos de este estudio.La red neuronal convolucional más rápida basada en una región recibió capacitación de 12,258 imágenes de RM pélvica de alta resolución con relajación transversal para construir una plataforma de inteligencia artificial y completar pruebas clínicas. En esta red, la proporción de imágenes con margen de resección circunferencial positivo y negativo fue 1: 2. De acuerdo con los resultados de las pruebas del grupo de validación, se aplicaron las métricas de las curvas de las características operativas del receptor y del área bajo la curva para comparar los resultados de diagnóstico de la plataforma de inteligencia artificial con los de expertos de radiología de alto nivel.En esta plataforma de inteligencia artificial, la precisión, sensibilidad y especificidad del estado del margen de resección circunferencial según lo determinado fueron 0.932, 0.838 y 0.956, respectivamente. El área bajo las curvas características de operación del receptor fue de 0.953.

METHODS: A total of 250 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum underwent multislice CT scans of the chest and abdomen before undergoing total mesorectal excision. The scans were scored by two teams. The main outcome was yes/no involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Histology was taken as the standard for determining the involvement. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity for predicting an involved mesorectal fascia was 74.2 percent and the overall specificity was 93.9 percent. The overall sensitivity for low tumors was 65.6 percent and the overall specificity was 81.5 percent. The overall sensitivity for mid-/high rectal tumors was 76.1 percent and the overall specificity was 96.3 percent. The interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa 0.695). The overall sensitivity for the prediction of liver metastases was 64.3 percent and the overall specificity was 94.4 percent with kappa 0.82. The accuracy in predicting lymph node metastases was low. CONCLUSIONS: Multislice CT can be used for the assessment of mesorectal fascia involvement in primary rectal cancer, especially those located in the middle rectum and the high rectum; however, in the prediction of an involved margin of tumors located in the distal rectum, the accuracy of multislice CT falls short.},

The aim of this review is to consider the indications and limitations of the current preoperative imaging modalities for rectal cancer staging including clinical examination, endorectal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and positron emission tomography-computed tomography, with respect to local and distant disease.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mucinous adenocarcinomas represent a potentially poor prognostic subgroup identifiable by imaging. We compared outcomes between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected rectal mucinous carcinoma and adenocarcinomas. The diagnostic performance of MRI compared with initial biopsy in detecting mucinous adenocarcinoma was also assessed. METHODS: The proportion of patients downstaged in the mrMucinous and adenocarcinoma groups was compared. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test independence of mucinous status and baseline MRI and clinical variables on survival. Differences in survival for mucinous versus non-mucinous tumours were tested for significance using the Mantel-Cox log rank test. RESULTS: 60/330 (18\%) patients were correctly diagnosed with mucinous rectal cancer based on pre treatment MRI compared with 15/330 (5\%) on initial biopsy (diagnostic odds ratio=4.67, p{$<$}0.05). All 60 (100\%) patients undergoing surgery for mrMucinous tumours were confirmed as such on final histopathology. Significantly fewer mrMucinous tumours showed ypT downstaging when compared with non-mucinous tumours (14/60 (23\%) versus 111/270 (40\%), p=0.01). Three-year survival outcomes for patients for MRI detected mucinous tumours were significantly worse: disease free survival (DFS) was 48\% versus 71\%, p=0.006 and OS was 69\% versus 79\% p=0.04. MRI Mucin was an independent variable for poor DFS (hazard ratios (HR)) 0.58 95\% Confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: MRI diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma is diagnostically superior to preoperative biopsy and occurs in up to 20\% of rectal cancer patients. It is an independent imaging biomarker for response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and prognosis. MRI documentation of mucinous status will enable future pursuit of treatment strategies in this poor prognostic subgroup.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and value of diffusion kurtosis (DK) imaging in assessing treatment response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). METHODS: Forty-one patients were included. All patients underwent pre- and post-CRT DCE-MRI on a 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner. Imaging indices (D app , K app and ADC values) were measured. Change value (∆X) and change ratio (r∆X) were calculated. Pathological tumour regression grade scores (Mandard) were the standard reference (good responders: pTRG 1-2; poor responders: pTRG 3-5). Diagnostic performance was compared using ROC analysis. RESULTS: For the pre-CRT measurements, pre-D app-10th was significantly lower in the good responder group than that of the poor responder group (p\,=\,0.036). For assessing treatment response to neoadjuvant CRT, pre-D app-10th resulted in AUCs of 0.753 (p\,=\,0.036) with a sensitivity of 66.67~\% and a specificity of 77.78~\%. The r∆D app had a relatively high AUC (0.859) and high sensitivity (100~\%) compared with other image indices. CONCLUSIONS: DKI is feasible for selecting good responders for neoadjuvant CRT for LARC. KEY POINTS: • LARC responded well after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with lower pre-D app-10th . • LARC responded well with greater increases in mean ADC and D app . • The change ratio of D app (r∆D app ) had a relatively better diagnostic performance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the relative accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the staging of colorectal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MR studies were independently interpreted in a group of 478 patients with colorectal carcinoma in a study conducted from 1989 to 1993. The accuracy of each modality was assessed in a subset of 365 patients with primary tumors with respect to staging of local extent of tumor, status of local-regional lymph nodes, and the presence of liver metastases. RESULTS: In the staging of local extent of tumor, CT is more accurate than MR imaging, particularly in the definition of penetration of the muscularis propria by rectal cancer (74\% vs 58\%). Accuracies of CT and MR imaging were equivalent in depiction of transmural extent in colon cancers. CT and MR imaging exhibited accuracies of 62\% and 64\% in assessment of lymph node involvement with sensitivities of 48\% and 22\%, respectively. The accuracy of MR imaging and of CT (85\% for each) are better for evaluation of liver metastases; lower sensitivities (62\% and 70\%, respectively) than specificities (97\% and 94\%, respectively) were demonstrated for both modalities. CONCLUSION: CT was more accurate than MR imaging in detection and characterization of transmural penetration of rectal tumors. Recent technologic advances in MR imaging may affect these results.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the value of the chemical shift effect (CSE) as well as other criteria for the prediction of lymph node status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who underwent radical surgery of rectal cancers were studied with pre- and postoperative specimen MRI. Lymph nodes were harvested from transverse whole-mount specimens and compared with in vivo and ex vivo images to obtain a precise slice-for-section match. Preoperative MR characteristics including CSE, as well as other predictors, were evaluated by two readers independently between benign and metastatic nodes. RESULTS: A total of 255 benign and 35 metastatic nodes were obtained; 71.4\% and 69.4\% of benign nodes were detected with regular CSE for two readers, whereas 80.0\% and 74.3\% of metastatic nodes with absence of CSE. The CSE rendered areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.879 and 0.845 for predicting nodal status for two readers. The criteria of nodal location, border, signal intensity and minimum distance to the rectal wall were also useful but with AUCs (0.629-0.743) lower than those of CSE. CONCLUSIONS: CSE is a reliable predictor for differentiating benign from metastatic nodes. Additional criteria should be taken into account when it is difficult to determine the nodal status by using only a single predictor. KEY POINTS: • CSE is good for predicting nodal status with high confidence. • Nodal border and signal intensity are useful for assessing nodal status. • Location of mesorectal nodes could facilitate the prediction of nodal status. • Primary tumour stage could be used as reference for nodal staging.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the accuracy of preoperative computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) in the prediction of nodal involvement in primary rectal carcinoma patients in the absence of tumor invasion into pelvic structures. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-two subjects with primary rectal cancer were preoperatively assessed by CT and MRI at 1.5 T with a phased-array coil. Preoperative lymph node staging with imaging modalities (CT, MRI, and DWIBS) were compared with the final histological findings. RESULTS: The accuracy of CT, MRI, and DWIBS were 57.7\%, 63.5\%, and 40.4\%. The accuracy of DWIBS with higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for evaluating primary rectal cancer patients was lower than that of CT and MRI. Nodal staging agreement between imaging and pathology was fairly strong for CT and MRI (Kappa value{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.331 and 0.348, P{$<$}0.01) but was relatively weaker for DWIBS (Kappa value{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.174, P{$<$}0.05). The accuracy was 57.7\% and 59.6\%, respectively, for CT and MRI when the lymph node border information was used as the criteria, and was 57.7\% and 61.5\%, respectively, for enhanced CT and MRI when the lymph node enhancement pattern was used as the criteria. CONCLUSION: MRI is more accurate than CT in predicting nodal involvement in primary rectal carcinoma patients in the absence of tumor invasion into pelvic structures. DWIBS has a great diagnostic value in differentiating small malignant from benign lymph nodes.},

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with rectal cancer diagnosed by fiber colonoscopy and pathology from March 2007 to December 2007 underwent preoperative 64-layers spiral CT examination. The degree of tumor infiltration in mesorectum and circumferential resection margin status were evaluated. Large tissue slice technique was applied in the pathologic study after the total mesorectal excision of the rectum to determine the degree of tumor infiltration in mesorectum and the circumferential resection margin status. The spiral CT findings were compared with pathologic results. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the CT results were assessed respectively. RESULTS: The overall spiral CT accuracy was 93.0\% (53/57) for the degree of tumor infiltration in mesorectum, and it was 94.7\%, 94.7\% and 96.5\% for degree I, II, III infiltration, respectively. Fifty-three cases (93.0\%) were accurately predicated with the circumferential resection margin status. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of spiral CT measurement was 80.0\%, 97.6\%, 92.3\% and 93.2\%, respectively, and was consistent well with the histopathological diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Spiral CT provides accurate preoperative assessment for the degree of tumor infiltration in mesorectum and circumferential resection margin status of rectal cancer.},
